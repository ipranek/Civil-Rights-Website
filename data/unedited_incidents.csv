The Brazilian government paid influencers to promote ineffective medication against COVID,"The Brazilian government invested more than US$268,000 in influencer marketing during the pandemic, of which around US$ 5,000 was given to a group of influencers tasked with promoting a series of pills (known in Brazil as atendimento precoce) that had been proved ineffective against COVID-19.","These pills were a crucial part of the Brazilian governments' response to the pandemic.

Court blocks access to news about suicide of a student,"Enes Kara, 19, was a second-year medical student at Elazığ Fırat University Medical Faculty. On January 11, Kara died by suicide. In a video recording that the 19-year-old left behind, he explained the unbearable compulsory indoctrination at the student housing his family sent him to live in, and the lack of hope for his future. “I have lost my entire joy for life and enthusiasm in the situation that I have found myself in,” Kara said in the video.
His video went viral on social media and reminded viewers of previous cases of violence, abuse, and murder at religious community-run student housing in recent years. 
Kara's father applied to a local court asking the court to block access to news reports of his son's suicide, on the grounds that the reports were an insult to his personal rights. The court ruled in favor of imposing access blocks on a number of news websites that published developments regarding Kara's suicide.

Supreme Court determines Telegram to be blocked in Brazil,"On Thursday, March 17th, 2022, a monocratic decision by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes mandated internet and data providers in Brazil to ""disable the use"" of Telegram in Brazil within 72 hours. The process was in secrecy, but it was leaked on Friday, when the country came to know about it. ","The decision was motivated by Telegram's non-compliance with previous court orders from the Supreme Court and the Supreme Electoral Court and an overall lack of cooperation with Brazilian authorities in the context of a program to fight misinformation in the 2022 Presidential Elections. Telegram also does not have a legal representative in Brazil, which has made the relationship with institutions unsustainable. 

More specifically, this decision by Justice Alexandre de Moraes was made on top of a representation by the Federal Police in the context of an investigation against far-right blogger Allan dos Santos, who is being investigated due to his involvement in a fake news scheme and the organization of anti-democratic demonstrations. The Federal Police was attempting to enforce against Telegram a court order by the Supreme Court in which the platform had to suspend Allan dos Santos from their service.

Internet disruptions on networks served by government-owned operator TelOne Recorded,"The Zimbabwe Republic Police stopped opposition party leader Nelson Chamisa from holding a rally on the 13th of March, 2022. Although the police blocked the rally from taking place, thousands of citizens took to the streets of Marondera to protest the police prohibition. Internet watchdog NetBlocks reported that there were significant disruptions on networks served by the government-owned operator TelOne. This disruption limited coverage of the protest and an anticipated political rally by the opposition leader. NetBlocks reported that data collated corroborated user reports of unexplained outages over the weekend of the planned rally, which was banned.
","Government and the ruling ZANU PF party remain in a state of paranoia about how to control the sweeping political tide of supporters, whom opposition leader Chamisa is gaining. His increased popularity poses an existential threat to the ruling party's political hegemony.

","The Ministry of Interior tracked users who were critical of government policies with regard to COVID 19, especially about the authorities hiding the true numbers (it turned out to be true because from March until September, people were only given information about diagnosed/symptomatic patients and only after much criticism and leaking of documents from hospitals doing tests did the real numbers begin to include/ reflect asymptomatic patients too). Mass lockdowns and few government incentives to support the public at large — especially those who were forced to stay home with no financial support or security — were common points of discussion online.

Bolsonaro's meeting with WhatsApps,"Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro meet with WhatsApp representatives in the Planalto Palace. According to a Folha de S. Paulo report, during the meeting, Bolsonaro insisted that WhatsApp launch its 'community' function in Brazil before the October 2022 general elections, despite a previous announcement from the company that it will only do so after the vote. The product is set to launch globally in September, one month before the Brazilian elections.","The motive is not 100% clear, but looking at it from an electoral perspective, we understand that WhatsApp is a very important tool for Bolsonaro's campaign due to its infrastructure. It allows information (including false and fabricated information) to spread easily and reach hundreds of thousands of people across the country, as it is present in 99% of Brazilians' phones. In 2018, it was crucial in helping him win, and is probably viewed as an important part of Bolsanaro's electoral strategy for 2022.

The TSE has set up a cooperation with nearly all tech platforms operating in Brazil (even Telegram), aiming to curb misinformation about the electoral process. 

Bolsanaro was irritated by the agreement. On the occasion he said (according to a Folha de S. Paulo report):  ""If they [WhatsApp] can make an agreement like this one with the TSE, they can make one with me too, why not? They can make one with you, with anyone. In Brazil, either a product is open to everyone or it is restricted for everyone"". One day before, he had said: ""I'll say that this that WhatsApp is doing around the world, fine, no problem. But opening an exception for Brazil, this is inadmissible and unacceptable"". 

WhatsApp made a commitment with the TSE to hold back the launch of ""communities"" in Brazil before an eventual second round in Brazil, scheduled for October 30th. The company, however, did not promise it will not launch the tool between the second round and the inauguration in Brazil, which happens right after New Year. This ""community tool"" will work like an umbrella, which will group together dozens of groups with thousands of members.

","According to the narrative pushed by the government, if WhatsApp makes agreements with the Supreme Electoral Court (TSE), then Bolsanaro would be entitled to similar agreements as well.

India: Mohammed Zubair is arrested for a social media post,"On 27 June 2022, Alt-news co-founder Mohammed Zubair was arrested by the Delhi Police’s Cyber Crime Unit following a complaint made by an anonymous user with the Twitter name ‘Hanuman Bhakt’ (English translation: a devotee of the Hindu God Hanuman).  The Tweet in question used an old movie poster to make a joke about how India had changed from after 2014 (the year when Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power). In the poster, the word ""Honeymoon"" hotel has been changed to ""Hanuman hotel"" and Zubair tweeted, ""Before 2014: Honeymoon Hotel and After 2014: Hanuman Hotel"". The subtext here is that Zubair was poking fun at the prevalence of Hindutva (Hindu supremacy ideology) that has gained momentum after the BJP came to power in 2014.

The Twitter user who reported the tweet to the police officials stated that Zubair had insulted the Hindu God Hanuman by making a reference to Honeymoon, especially as Hanuman is considered to be a ""Brahmchari"" (celibate) who does not engage in sexual acts. 

Following the complaint, Zubair was charged under Section 153A and Section 295A of the Indian Penal code (IPC). Under Section 153, an individual can be charged for “promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony,” while Section 295 A penalises “deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage reli­gious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or reli­gious beliefs.” On July 2, 2022, additional charges of criminal conspiracy, causing the disappearance of evidence and violating foreign funding rules, were also filed against him by the police

In addition to the 2018 tweet case, over the next few weeks, new First Incident Reports (FIRs) were lodged for content Zubair had posted, and previous cases were investigated — essentially a legal witch hunt. Eventually, a ""Special Investigation Team"" was formed to probe six out of seven cases. On July 15, 2022, a Delhi court granted Zubair bail subject to certain conditions in the 2018 tweet case, reasoning that “The voice of dissent is necessary for a healthy democracy. Therefore, for mere criticism of any political parties it is not justified to invoke Section 153A (promoting enmity) and 295A (deliberate and malicious acts to outrage religious feelings) of the IPC.” The court also held that Zubair had not violated the foreign funding rules. However, he continued to be held in the other cases. On July 19, 2022, looking into the matter, the Supreme Court expressed concern about the “vicious cycle” of him getting bail in one case only to be held in another despite the contents of the FIRs filed being “similar” and decided to club the cases together. A day later, the SC granted him conditional bail in all cases and rejected the state government of Uttar Pradesh’s plea to stop him from tweeting. ","The exact motive is unclear as there are multiple perspectives on the issue. According to media sources, the Delhi police said, “The said post of Mohd. Zubair containing picture & words against a particular religious community are highly provocative & done deliberately which are more than sufficient to incite hatred among people which can be detrimental for maintenance of public tranquillity.” 

In another statement, reported in The Hindustan Times, a police official investigating the matter has said efforts will be made to “bust the social media brigade which Zubair has.” The official added, “It appears that his tweets are planned and pushed in a concerted manner. They are amplified by an army of people. If these are bots then who is paying these bots. We are digging deep into this network that amplifies his tweets.” 

On the other hand, press bodies such as the Editor's Guild of India, have attributed the arrest to Altnews' role in debunking mis/disinformation in the country. They call the arrest 'disturbing' in the statement and note that ""It is apparent that AltNews' alert vigilance was resented by those who use disinformation as a tool to polarise society and rake nationalist sentiments.""

Tanzania: Parliament to table proposal for data protection law,"Over the years, there have been calls by ICT stakeholders for the Tanzanian government to enact a Data Protection Act in efforts to guarantee the privacy of personal data. These calls seem to have borne fruit as the cabinet just approved a draft Data Protection Bill that was scheduled to be tabled in parliament for the first time on the 13th of September 2022. However, with the increasing number of cases where dissenting voices are being arrested and detained by the state security apparatus, it is widely feared that this proposed law will be used to crack down on people who criticize the government using online platforms. The idea behind enacting such a law is purportedly meant to protect citizens' privacy rights, yet the motive is the entrenching of digital authoritarianism, with the law being used to silence voices of dissent.","The government is seeking to regulate data on digital platforms in a bid to curb the abuse of citizens' personal liberties. There is concern over the sharing of information with third parties without the consent of users, with the ICT Minister proposing an examination of what he terms ethics of internet use 'to the extent that it is governable.' This has raised concern among civil society and other stakeholders that the proposed law must be drafted cautiously, while taking into account citizens' rights enshrined in the constitution.
Considering the government's increasingly authoritarian stance, targeting journalists, activists and voices of dissent, it is imperative to note that a swiftly-passed data protection act which fails to factor in the input of the broad range of stakeholders would be inimical to democracy in the country. The government usually passes laws which swiftly sail through parliament, where the ruling party has a majority vote. On the balance of probabilities, the government is likely interested in passing a law that would criminalize freedom of the media and freedom of speech online, as the security establishment is already clamping down on voices of dissent. In other words, the state is likely seeking a legal means to crack down on civil society activists, journalists and political opponents, who may be a thorn in the flesh of the state apparatus.","The state is committed to respecting privacy and protecting citizens' data,The government is committed to delivering a good data protection law,Social media should comply with state regulations to ensure content and activity online are in line with the law,Freedom of expression is not an absolute right","Data protection acts are vital for democracy,The government should not be able to access citizen data without legal justification,State authorities do not care about citizens' privacy,Surveillance of citizens violates their fundamental rights ",Tanzania,8 Eylül 2022,"Privacy violations,Surveillance","Data Governance,Data Governance","Ulinzi wa Data: Sheria zinalenga kuwapa watu binafsi uwezo wa kujua jinsi Taarifa zao zinavyotumiwa,Ulinzi wa Data: Wakusanya taarifa wengi hawana namna nzuri ya kuzitunza,Ulinzi wa Data: Sheria ya Kulinda Taarifa ni muhimu,Hoja za msingi za kwanini Tanzania inahitaji Sheria ya Ulinzi wa Data,Maxence Melo: Hadi sasa hakuna sheria rasmi ya kulinda taarifa binafsi za watu nchini,CHANGAMOTO ZA KISHERIA: Utekelezaji wa sheria mpya haujumuishi ulinzi wa data na faragha,TIGO: KWETU UTII KWA MAMLAKA NI KIPAUMBELE KULIKO FARAGHA ZA WATEJA,Baraza la Mawaziri  limeridhia kutungwa kwa sheria ya kulinda taarifa binafsi,Stakeholders cautiously welcome data protection bill,Jinsi kampuni za simu Tanzania zinavyoweza kutoa taarifa za siri za wateja wao,Kesi ya Mbowe: Shahidi aibua utata kuhusu IMEI za simu za watuhumiwa,Data privacy under scrutiny amid legal vacuum in Tanzania,Tanzania urged to regulate digital ID privacy,""Tanzania: NIDA IDs for civic services, or not?"",Ulinzi wa Taarifa Binafsi na Faragha: Usimpige Picha wala kumchukua Video karani wa Sensa bila ridhaa yake,Makarani wa Sensa waonywa kurekodi video wakati mahojiano",,State authority,"Nape Nnauye, Minister of Information, Communication & ICT ","Information, Communication and Information Technology Minister Nape Nnauye recently informed ICT stakeholders that a proposed data protection law would be tabled in parliament for the first time.

Zimbabwe Journalist Hopewell Chin’ono’s freedom bid flops again,"A Harare court, on the 22nd of June 2022, dismissed independent journalist Hopewell Chin'ono's application for removal from remand, after he was accused of having obstructed the course of justice. He is accused of tweeting statements likely to incite public violence and for obstruction of justice. He was arrested and imprisoned over both tweets in January and November 2021. The latest dismissed court case is related to Chin'ono having tweeted statements deemed to be an obstruction of public justice ahead of a judicial decision in November 2021. 
Lancelot Mutsokoti, who represented the state, had requested the court to postpone the matter to the 6th of July  2022, arguing that the docket was still in the possession of the Prosecutor-General’s Office. Only after it is released and availed by the Prosecutor-General can it be brought to court for trial.
However, the State has continually requested for postponement of the trial, citing a plethora of reasons. For instance, the State at one stage once argued that it hadn't yet received a response from Twitter's head office to verify if Chin'ono's Twitter credentials matched the credentials in the database of authorized users and the data authentication server.
Chin’ono then recommended to the court to check with the Africa Desk in Ireland, where queries from Africa are dealt with. The legal persecution of Chin'ono is ongoing and under the media spotlight.","Hopewell Chin'ono is a known government critic and investigative journalist reputed for exposing corruption and nepotism in the government. He has been a thorn in the state's efforts to cover up apparent cases of corruption and abuse of taxpayers' funds, hence his continued persecution and legal harassment would be in President Emmerson Mnangagwa's interests to intimidate other journalists from pursuing similar investigative exposes. As a whistleblowing journalist, Chin'ono published a report in 2020 exposing a COVID-19 Personal Protective Equipment procurement scandal, which led to the sacking of the then minister of Health, Obadiah Moyo. The security forces later arrested Chin'ono on allegations of incitement to cause public violence, a move described by international critics as an onslaught on press and digital freedom.","Journalists who criticize the government are enemies of the state,The state respects press freedom,Freedom of expression is not an absolute right,Foreign-funded NGOs and media outlets are a threat to the country","It is the government's duty to protect journalists and ensure they can work safely,States should not crack down on dissent and criticism,Under no circumstances should the state be able to jail journalists,The country's press freedom is in decline,Journalists should be able to report on abuses of power without being surveilled or harmed in other ways",Zimbabwe,22 Haziran 2022,"Freedom of information,Legislation,Freedom of opinion,Freedom of expression","Speech,Access,Speech,Speech","Zimbabwe Arrests Journalist Over Tweet on President,Zimbabwe Court Convicts Reporter for The New York Times,""Journalists brutally assaulted by soldiers, police in Harare suburb"",Zimbabwean journalist threatened with assault after corruption reporting,Zimbabwe police detain and charge 2 journalists covering attempted arrest of opposition politician,Be wary of NGOs intent on usurping State Power,Chinese threats on The Standard condemned,2 in Big Trouble after being found at Gweru Airforce of Zimbabwe plane crash scene by soldiers,""SA Editors Call Charamba, Mangwana to order over harassment of SABC journalists"",Chamisa a predator of press freedom,""Zimbabwe journalist Elizabeth Mashiri detained, charged for filming police clash with vendors"",Journalists charged with publishing false data messages,Media groups slam First Lady’s attack on journos,Zimbabwean journalist Anyway Yotamu charged after assault by police,Freedom of Expression and incitement not the same thing-defiant top author tells court as public violence trial starts,Journalists urged to promote country's image,Zimbabwe Journalists Cry Out for More Freedom,High Court refuses Sikhala and Sithole bail; MPs have been in detention for 22 days,Chinhoyi Zupco event: ED security bars 10 private media journos for ‘late coming’,State of siege: Zimbabwe puts the boot in journalism and freedom of speech",,State authority,Harare magistrates court,"The state is systematically clamping down on independent journalists who expose corruption in the top echelons of government using what critics call 'lawfare.'

Zimbabwe: Cabinet resolution to introduce SMART cities traffic management system,"The government of Zimbabwe is set to introduce a SMART cities traffic management system across major urban areas of the country, according to a cabinet resolution adopted on the 17th of May, 2022. Cameras which capture the data of various persons will be installed at all major intersections and what the government terms 'strategic points' to 'gather information' and monitor traffic flow. 

The idea behind the camera rollout is to enhance operational efficiencies in law enforcement and traffic management, according to the cabinet resolution. Considering President Mnangagwa's obsession with consolidating power and keeping dissenting voices under check as part of authoritarian rule, the camera rollout is, in essence, part of the broader pervasive and panoptic surveillance measures being implemented by his administration. This ties into the key thematic area of data governance, with a particular focus on privacy and surveillance, effectively revealing digital totalitarianism in Zimbabwe.","The government led by President Emmerson Mnangagwa is exploring as many methods as possible to crack down on voices of dissent in the country, including promulgating a raft of draconian laws and the use of expensive surveillance technology. Ever since the military coup of November 2017, which deposed the late strongman Robert Mugabe, Mnangagwa has become increasingly paranoid about the prospect of being removed from power by popular protest. His regime's strategy, therefore, has been to use a specific and targeted approach to dealing with political threats through surveillance, use of spyware, isolation and arrests of perceived enemies of the state. The rollout of surveillance technology could not have come at a better time, as the country heads for elections in 2023. The main motive for the use of surveillance cameras is not for the security of the public as officially announced, but for clamping down on opposition party leaders, journalists, lawyers and other voices of dissent.",States' use of surveillance technology makes the country safer,"Surveillance companies shouldn't sell their technology to authoritarian countries,Smart cities initiatives are smokescreens for surveilling citizens and violating their rights,Governments should not acquire spyware,The military should not be involved in monitoring social media,China backs digital authoritarianism around the world,Journalists should be able to report on abuses of power without being surveilled or harmed in other ways,Democratic nations should stop selling surveillance technology to authoritarian regimes,Surveillance of citizens violates their fundamental rights ",Zimbabwe,17 Mayıs 2022,"Legislation,Surveillance,Freedom of opinion,Freedom of expression","Access,Data Governance,Speech,Speech","POTRAZ has started monitoring your calls.

The official narrative pushed over the years is that protests in any form are anti-Zimbabwe and should not be exercised by law abiding and patriotic nationals. However, a close examination of the country's political history shows that the ZANU PF regime has always resented popular protest unless it is in their strategic interests, such as the deposing of Mugabe in November 2017 for example.

This will involve extensive and in depth interviews with experts, journalists and opposition party activists who have been subjected to such surveillance measures and the consequent effects thereof. The findings of the journalistic work can be incorporated into broader research efforts into digital and human rights violations in Zimbabwe.
","It would be imperative to continue research on the extent to which the government is committed to spying on citizens and voices of dissent as part of a grand plan to create a surveillance state. Chinese company Hikvision is involved in rolling out cameras with facial recognition capabilities. Huawei is also involved in strategic partnerships with local mobile network operators for purposes of infrastructure upgrade. Huawei technology is banned in a number of Western countries as its software is fraught with backdoors and middleboxes, which intercept user data. Advocacy efforts aimed at exposing the unconstitutionality of the violation of citizens' privacy rights would be a highly useful pushback against such authoritarianism. Writing and publishing a series of articles about how and why the state security establishment is using spyware and surveillance cameras would also be useful as part of broad advocacy efforts.

"Tanzania publishes EPOCA, resulting in stricter online content regulation","The Electronic and Postal Communications (SIM Card Registration) Regulations – EPOCA (the SCR Regulations) were published by the Tanzanian government in 2020. These regulations are aimed at curtailing freedom of expression online and cutting down media freedom. A number of the attached items in this analysis indicate that the government is using this law to suppress constitutionally enshrined freedom of expression and the media.
Additionally, the regulations require Tanzanian nationals and residents to register their SIM cards through a new biometric registration system launched by the Tanzania Communication Regulatory Authority (TCRA). It is important to note that the TCRA has served as a useful tool for the government to crack down on voices of dissent by summoning editors, denying license renewals and openly censuring criticism of the government.
As part of its broader efforts to encourage self-censorship and instill a sense of fear within the populace, Tanzanians are required to register with the National Identification Authority (NIDA), and share their fingerprints and documents detailing their proof of identity. Their NID/NIN (National Identification/National Identification Number) is then linked to a registered SIM card. This abrogates the government's unfettered powers to easily identify and persecute any individual who criticizes state policies or offer counter-narratives to the status quo.
Considering that Tanzania does not have any data protection legislation, it makes communication interception likely, which impedes on privacy rights. Further, state security may use this lacuna to intercept communication under the pretext of criminal investigations and or national security, yet it would be a political ruse to crack down on voices of dissent.
The widely criticized EPOCA Regulations also require that internet cafes install CCTVs on their premises, and keep a record of their internet services users (Name, ID, telephone number).","To monitor and surveil people's actions online, and ensure that they are in accordance with the law.","The government is committed to delivering a good data protection law,The state is committed to respecting privacy and protecting citizens' data,Social media should comply with state regulations to ensure content and activity online are in line with the law,Freedom of expression is not an absolute right","Tanzania's press laws oppress local media,Journalists should be able to report on abuses of power without being surveilled or harmed in other ways,States should not crack down on dissent and criticism,The country's press freedom is in decline,Governments' media legislation always ends up curbing press freedom,Journalists should be able to protect their sources,The government's taxing of internet use is an infringement of citizens' rights,Under no circumstances should the state be able to jail journalists,COVID-19 has accelerated techno-authoritarianism,Independent institutions are a fundamental requirement for democracy,Internet access is a human right,It is the government's duty to protect journalists and ensure they can work safely,States must not engage in censorship,The government is targeting LGBTQ+ people online,The state is using national legislation to silence online dissent",Tanzania,17 Temmuz 2020,"Service interruptions,Privacy violations,Freedom of information,Legislation,Punitive taxation,Disinformation and misinformation,Freedom of opinion,Freedom of expression","Access,Data Governance,Speech,Access,Access,Information,Speech,Speech","TCRA suspends ‘Shule ya Uongozi’ on Polepole’s online TV ,Mdhibiti wa mawasiliano Tanzania afungia kituo cha habari cha mtandaoni cha DarMpya,No respite in suppression of media in Tanzania,Jamii Forums founder Maxence Melo convicted on obstruction charge,‘A rush of relief’: Tanzanian investigative newspaper allowed to publish after 5-year ban,Journalists Reflect on the State of Media in Tanzania,Deluge of Digital Repression Threatens African Security,‘Tunataka taasisi imara na huru’,‘Licensing Requirements Cause Self-censorship Among Media Practitioners’,TCRA: Lapdog wa makampuni guard dog dhidi ya maoni ya watu,DarMpya Rebrands to ZamaMpya As TCRA Declines to Renew Its License,Sheria taarifa za faragha yaiva,Tanzania: Charges against comedian for laughing must be thrown out,Utahitaji Kibali cha TCRA Kuweza Kuishitaki TCRA Mahakamani,TCRA yaitoza faini Sh2 milioni Zama Mpya OnlineTV ,Ofisa TRC aliyepinga tozo za miamala ya simu afukuzwa kazi,""Baada ya ZamaMpya Tv Kupigwa faini na Kamati ya Maudhui ya TCRA kutokana na kuchapisha maoni ya Afande Sele kuhusiana na Tozo za miamala, tumeombwa tuweke utaratibu wa kukusanya michango ili tuweze kulipa faini hiyo ya 2Milioni"",""Taxing the Internet is not only absurd, it is outright dangerous"",Government warns over ‘same-sex’ content,Bado uhuru wa habari upo kwenye mashaka,Tanzanian communication regulator suspends DarMpya online news outlet,Minister Summons Online TV Following Report On the Increased Cost of Cell Phone Plans,""Tanzania police arrest cartoonist, journalists on cybercrime and illegal assembly allegations"",CPJ calls on Tanzania president to reform press laws,Why It’s Important for Government to Allow Free Flow of Information in the Ongoing Ngorongoro Saga,Internet Censorship 2022: A Global Map of Internet Restrictions,Tanzanian cartoonist detained over cartoon of president,Tanzania’s newly passed law entrenches digital rights repression,Misinformation undefined as TCRA urges citizen to report COVID-19 misinformation ,Tanzania’s repressive online laws have forced the “Swahili Wikileaks” to close",,State authority,Tanzania Communication Regulatory Authority (TCRA),"The government issued a Gazette Notice: GN No. 538 of 2020. The notice regards the Electronic and Postal Communications (Online Content) regulations. These regulations have a substantial bearing on the operations of various internet-related stakeholders, ranging from content service providers, ISPs and online content users, among others. The regulations are being used by the government of President Hassan to clamp down on the media and citizens who freely express themselves online. As shown by the linked items, a number of comedians, artists, cartoonists, journalists and other voices of dissent are being systematically targeted for persecution and prosecution under the guise of regulating online content. Provisions in the law also abrogate too much power in the hands of the TCRA by forcing any citizen who intends to sue the TCRA to first apply to the latter, stating their intention to sue. The TCRA can then determine whether one can sue or not. The TCRA is also empowered under EPOCA regulations to renew and refuse to renew any media operators' license at its sole discretion. The rebranding of a media outlet called Dar Mpya to Zama Mpya on account of the TCRA's refusal to renew its operating license is a case in point of growing digital authoritarianism in Tanzania.

Investigative journalists reveal that the Hungarian government has been using Pegasus spyware on critics,"In 2018, the Hungarian government started deploying the Pegasus spyware; according to the investigative reporting done by Direkt36, it targeted approximately 300 Hungarian citizens. Many of the targets are journalists, influential business actors with control over independent media, civil society actors, and critics of the government. The government first did not admit that it bought and used the software but a few months later it did confirm the allegation. ","The Hungarian government has a long history of attacking, intimidating, and discrediting civil society, media workers, and critical voices. It started with the stigmatization of civil society organizations that receive funding from abroad. The variety of tools it applied to stifle dissenting voices became more diverse over the years. The Pegasus case is, however, distinct from these, as, without the investigation, we wouldn’t have known about it. The other attacks on civil society were more public and were linked to the creation of a false public image of those actors.

Pegasus is a spyware developed by the Israeli NSO Group, a private company. NSO can sell spyware to governments only with the Israeli defence authority's permission, indicating how serious a tool it is. According to the reporting done by [Direkt36](https://www.direkt36.hu/en/tag/pegasus/), a Hungarian investigative journalist organization, the Hungarian government bought the spyware from NSO in 2018 when Hungarian-Israeli relations started to strengthen. When the reporting came out, the government neither denied nor confirmed that it ever used the software. 

However, thanks to the international investigation conducted by several news outlets as well as [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/07/hungary-the-government-must-provide-a-meaningful-response-to-the-pegasus-scandal-2/) and [Citizen Lab](https://citizenlab.ca/), it became clear that Pegasus was used on several phones in Hungary. Direkt36 found, with the help of Amnesty International's technical testing, that four journalists, media owners, government critics, and several others (all together approximately 300 targets) were targeted with the software. 

Months after the story broke, the Hungarian government admitted to using the software, but the Hungarian data protection authority did not find any violations.

There are no rigid requirements for surveillance, and whatever there is does not come under the authority of an independent body. The most recent Pegasus instance demonstrated that this is a real issue when it was discovered that Hungarian individuals' cell phones had been compromised for no apparent cause related to national security.

Independent UN experts condemn internet and communication shutdown in Kashmir,"On 22 August 2019, independent UN experts, including the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, issued a statement condemning the Indian government's move to impose a complete internet and communication shutdown in Kashmir. In the statement issued, the experts condemn the move and describe it as: “The shutdown of the internet and telecommunication networks, without justification from the Government, are inconsistent with the fundamental norms of necessity and proportionality,” They add: “The blackout is a form of collective punishment of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, without even a pretext of a precipitating offence.”
(Further reading:  https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2019/08/un-rights-experts-urge-india-end-communications-shutdown-kashmir )

A day before the Union government abrogated Article 370, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, it imposed restrictions on movement and connectivity.  Besides targeting the internet and telecommunications, there were restrictions on movement on the ground; local leaders were detained, and the press was not allowed to report freely. 

This was the beginning of a series of communication blockades in the form of social media bans, landline restrictions, provision of only 2G services, etc. 4G services were restored on 5th February 2021.","The restrictions were likely imposed to curb any protests or agitations arising from the sudden abrogation of Article 370. As per news sources, the government justified the restrictions by calling them necessary to ensure national security and peace in the region.  In Parliament, addressing concerns about the lack of internet and communication facilities, Home Minister Amit Shah clarified that these measures were necessary for ""preventing some nefarious elements from instigating violence in the State"" and that ""no one can stop the government to take precautionary measures to protect the peace inside the country.""
Speaking to media sources, an article published in 2022 notes that the Minister of Foreign Affairs commented: ""The big song and dance about the internet being cut…if you've reached a stage where you say that an internet cut is more dangerous than loss of human lives, then what can I say?"" 
The government has described the abrogation as a positive move that was much needed. In a press note, it described the move as follows: ""The Indian parliament passed legislation last month changing the status of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, modifying provisions that have been an obstacle to economic development and promoted a sense of separatism.

"Investigation into China reveals that the country expanded the scope of its surveillance, asking hotels to place police cameras in their lobbies.","Researchers of digital authoritarianism have investigated many incidents revealing the Chinese's government extensive use of surveillance technology. This incident helps us go one step further to understand how the Chinese police expanded the scope of government-led surveillance. 

The New York Times reviewed over 100,000 documents provided by the digital magazine ChinaFile regarding the increasing use of surveillance technologies in the country. According to records, the Chinese police wanted to place cameras in places where people go to fulfill their common needs, like eating, traveling, shopping and entertainment. 

One finding in the documents was that the police wanted to place facial recognition cameras in hotel lobbies, such as Sheraton Hotel. This incident shows that the government attempts to expand its surveillance from the streets to hotels and many other places, violating the privacy of its citizens.

To fully understand China's expanding surveillance and control mechanism, it is essential to note that the government cooperates with big tech companies which are producing surveillance technologies. For this very reason, Hikvision and Dahua, two Chinese companies dominating the surveillance technology market, were sanctioned by the United States for taking part in China's human rights violations.

The items linked to this incident approach it from a thematic perspective, looking at media items related to this incident and to surveillance at a broader level, asking, ""How are states justifying their surveillance measures and how are civil society actors responding?""","The main motivation of the Chinese government is to create an overarching control mechanism in the country, which would help the government track, control, and punish its citizens' activities. In so doing, the government could regulate the behaviors, especially of its minorities, and prevent them from getting organized against the government's atrocities.

"The Facebook Papers reveal that the company did not take the necessary measures to protect young people, prevent the spread of disinformation, and stop surveillance of Uyghurs on the platform.","The Facebook Papers refer to a set of internal documents that were provided to Congress by whistleblower Frances Haugen's legal counsel. Haugen used to work as a product manager for Facebook. Then, she decided to testify and reveal what she knew about how the company posed a risk to vulnerable people and democracy.

Here is what the Facebook Papers reveal:
- Facebook's administration knew that Facebook and Instagram were affecting young people's mental health severely, but they did not take any measures to change this situation, eliminate the risks, and improve the platform's algorithms accordingly.
- Facebook administration's negligence of disinformation and conspiracy theories on its platforms played a major role in the organization of insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. A Facebook employee took responsibility by posting the following message to the internal board of the company: ""We've been fueling this fire for a long time, and we shouldn't be surprised it's now out of control."" 
- Facebook administration was well-aware of the fact that the Chinese government was surveilling Uyghurs, a Turkic-Muslim minority group mostly known for the cultural genocide they face. However, the administration ignored state surveillance for the sake of the company's profit in the Asian markets.
- Despite being one of the leading social media companies in the world, Facebook did not hire enough experts who could speak different languages and have expertise in different regions of the world. Therefore, the company failed to follow and remove hateful content in many languages, such as Arabic. 

The Facebook Papers, as an incident, is included in this project to point out a broader picture of how big tech companies and private actors jeopardize human rights and democracy, pose a risk of exacerbating digital authoritarianism, and facilitate state-led surveillance. From the insurrection in the U.S. Capitol to the surveillance of Uyghurs, the Facebook Papers reveal that big tech companies pose a risk to people in democracies and non-democracies. To that end, this incident includes items about technology firms from around the world that facilitate digital authoritarian practices in different countries.","This scandal is about a company, not a state. According to whistleblower Haugen, Facebook's main motive was to profit more from platform users by neglecting the violation of platform rules or the potential harm that Facebook content caused people. 
At this point, it is important to discuss Facebook's business model, which relies heavily on profit-making through advertisements. Just in July 2022, Facebook had [nearly 3 billion active users monthly](http://Facebook had 2.934 billion monthly active users in July 2022,(a) placing it 1st in our ranking of the world’s most ‘active’ social media platforms.), making the platform the most popular social media site in the world. Therefore, advertising on Facebook is advantageous for business companies aiming to reach a global audience. To keep its number of users high, Facebook does not frequently remove users who share harmful content, does not easily take down content, or in a general sense, does not interfere with the platform often. This is the main reason why Facebook's business model is problematic and harms its users.","Facebook is taking adequate steps to curb mis- and disinformation during elections,The Facebook Papers paint a false picture of Facebook","The rampant spread of misinformation and disinformation is an urgent issue,Meta's business model is based on user manipulation,Facebook has too much power,Meta products have a negative impact on users' mental health,Social media platforms don't care about users,Social media platforms have failed at fighting disinformation,Social media platforms should proactively identify coordinated harmful networks and take them down","United States of America,China (and Hong Kong)",1 Eylül 2021,"Service interruptions,Privacy violations,Freedom of information,Legislation,Disinformation and misinformation,Surveillance,Coordinated inauthentic behavior and influence campaigns,Freedom of opinion,Freedom of expression","Access,Data Governance,Speech,Access,Information,Data Governance,Information,Speech,Speech","Key takeaways from Facebook’s whistle-blower hearing,Facebook Does Something Right for a Change,""Inside Facebook, Jan. 6 violence fueled anger, regret over missed warning signs"",""Mark Zuckerberg rejects profits claim, slams 'false picture' of Facebook"",Meta is facing 8 lawsuits that claim Facebook and Instagram lure young people into addiction for profit,Facebook is rebranding everything but faces the same old problems,Mark Zuckerberg says he’s ‘proud of everything’ Facebook does hours after blockbuster whistleblower testimony,Digital Human Rights Need a Single Home in U.S. Government,Big Tech tried to quash Russian propaganda.

Examples, as listed above, include the neglect of the impact of usage on young people's mental health; denying the role played by Facebook in the storming of the US Capitol in 2021; turning a blind eye to Chinese surveillance of Uyghurs on the platform; and also falling short in moderating hate speech in a number of languages.

Venezuelan regional elections spark rise of website and digital media blocks,"During the regional elections (where mayors, governors and community leaders are chosen) in November 2021, VE Sin Filtro (an NGO that has been documenting censorship and web blocking since 2014) determined that over 56 key web domains relevant to the election were blocked during the month of November, which prevented users from accessing information, as traditional media outlets have disappeared or are subject to censorship.
Between January and December 2021, VE Sin Filtro found that 59 websites corresponding to at least 68 domains were blocked. Forty-five of these were media sites; eight belonged to portals that offer political content; four had been designed to share multimedia content; three are run by human rights organizations, six had adult content, and two were VPN (Virtual Private Network) platforms used to avoid censorship.

Bukele's government threatens lawsuit against two women journalists,"The independent news media Gato Encerrado published a story that the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice was ready to release a resolution that allows President Nayib Bukele the possibility of reelection. This story, published by two women journalists, Karen Moreno and Beatriz Benitez, also mentioned that Javier Argueta, legal adviser to Bukeles's government, attended a private meeting with the Magistrates of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. After that, Javier Argueta expressed that he might present a lawsuit against these two journalists if they wouldn't reveal the source of the information that mentioned him as participating in a private meeting. The two journalists replied that the source of this information was anonymous and that they have the right of protecting the sources of information. There were local and international reactions condemning this threat, but Argueta did not proceed with any lawsuit against the two journalists of Gato Encerrado.","In this incident, there are several elements involved: first the news story is about a controversial topic, which is the possibility of Bukele's reelection.

Turkish state grants the Turkish Football Federation the right to block websites,"In December 2021, an article added to law No. 5894 (Law on the Establishment and Duties of the Turkish Football Federation) granted the Turkish Football Federation authority to block access to broadcasts and URLs in case the federation determines the broadcasts to be illegal.

However, if the URL cannot be blocked, the TFF Board of Directors will be able to block access to the entire site without court approval.

The TFF Board of Directors will forward the access ban decision to the Access Providers Association. This censorship decision, taken without a court order, can be appealed at the Criminal Court of Peace within a week. Persons in the unit established within the TFF to implement the access ban decision will also be able to use this authority if requested.

With this authority granted to the federation, it can censor video content including match summaries, score footage from the games, and even blocking of entire sites due to these broadcasts.

Legal experts have described the move as ""an undisputed censorship"" and ""unconstitutional"" (<https://kronos35.news/tr/tffye-sansur-yetkisi-diledigi-web-sitesini-mahkeme-karari-olmadan-engelleyebilecek/>).

How the blocking works: 

Broadcasting organizations notify the TFF about illegal broadcasting sites on the internet. The Turkish Football Federation takes a decision to block access based on the newly granted powers under the amendment to the law. Then TFF conveys this decision to the Access Providers Union. The union also blocks access to the relevant site (<https://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/spor/tff-harekete-gecmisti-866-siteye-erisim-engeli-1910068>).

According to lawyer Kerem Altiparmak, the authority given to the TFF is unconstitutional and paves the way for censorship. Altiparmak points out that the biggest problem with the authority given to the TFF is the seven-day deadline to appeal the blocking decision. “There is a measurement problem here. Why seven days? The Information Technologies Authority makes a decision on blocking access in matters related to public order and national security, and yet this decision is submitted to the judge's approval within 24 hours. Under normal circumstances, if such authorization is given, they should have submitted to the approval of the judge within 24 hours and brought a condition for repeal.” ([Source](https://www-freewebturkey-com.translate.goog/turkiye-futbol-federasyonuna-sansur-yetkisi/?_x_tr_sl=tr&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc))

There has been no official explanation about the decision or the duration of the period granted to appeal TFF's decision. Thus, it makes the decision ambiguous and unpredictable. For this reason, lawyers such as Altiparmak think such decisions are open to arbitrariness and abuse. 
","The decision was backed by the incentive to prevent illegal broadcasts of the games. But in the absence of due recourse, not notifying the ""owner"" or the ""creator"" of the content leads to arbitrariness which is not questioned by the power granting authority nor by the implementor.

This was a pilot ruling in the case of blocked websites/content in Turkey, making it a significant one.

Russia claims the photos and videos of the Mariupol maternity hospital bombing are staged,"On the 9th of March, 2022, the Russian military bombed a children’s hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine. The news caused an outcry on social media and became the first major story about the alleged war crimes of the Russian government in the 2022 Ukraine invasion. The Russian government launched a global disinformation campaign to justify the attack. They claimed that the photos and videos of the independent and pro-Ukrainian media were fake; coordinated the spread of pro-Russian misinformation, and encouraged cyberstalking and cyberbullying of the protagonist and the main source of the story, as well as their friends. 
The story circled around Marianna Vyshemirskaya, a beauty blogger from Mariupol and a survivor of the hospital attack. Two Associated Press (AP) journalists (Evgeniy Maloletka and Mstyslav Chernov) took the photos and videos of her evacuating the hospital, which became viral. Pro-Russian Telegram channels quickly identified Vyshemirskaya and used her profession as proof that the photoshoot had been completely staged. In the following weeks, both Russian and western media released more videos allegedly featuring Marianna and used them as evidence in the discussion of what happened and who was responsible. 
Among the social media accounts participating in disinformation, cyberstalking, and cyberbullying, many demonstrated coordinated inauthentic behaviour and had links with the Russian government.","To discredit the allegations against the Russian military for killing civilians, especially pregnant women and children.","Western media and social media platforms are hostile and biased against Russia and Russians,The Ukrainian army disregards the well-being of Ukrainian citizens,Ukraine is producing fake evidence to accuse Russia of war crimes,Russia is liberating Ukraine from its Nazi regime,Ukraine commits war crimes against its own citizens,The Russian media landscape is friendly and diverse,The Russian military's airstrikes are highly precise and never target civilians,The Ukrainian military has been terrorising the civilians of DPR and LPR,The West controls Ukraine's media,The goal of Western propaganda is to dehumanise Russians,The ‘West’ is manufacturing fake evidence to accuse Russia of war crimes,""Twitter, Facebook and other mainstream social media platforms are politically biased""","Russia is waging an illegal war of aggression in Ukraine and is targeting civilians,The Russian state and state media are spreading disinformation about Russia's war in Ukraine,Government and state-owned media should not sponsor mis/disinformation and defamation campaigns,The rampant spread of misinformation and disinformation is an urgent issue,Social media platforms should proactively identify coordinated harmful networks and take them down,Internet shutdowns and disruptions are hugely detrimental to society,Social media platforms have failed at fighting disinformation,It is never acceptable for governments to shut down the internet,Russia's attempts to manipulate cyberspace outside its borders is more widespread than is commonly believed,Social media platforms must help in the fight for democracy ,The Russian state is censoring independent media's coverage of the Ukrainian invasion","Russia,Ukraine",9 Mart 2022,"Service interruptions,Privacy violations,Freedom of information,Disinformation and misinformation,Coordinated inauthentic behavior and influence campaigns,Freedom of opinion,Freedom of expression","Access,Data Governance,Speech,Information,Information,Speech,Speech","Air strike into the centre of Mariupol hit maternity hospital…  +10 photos,Війська росії цілеспрямовано та безжалісно знищують мирне населення Маріуполя + 1 photo,Social media users share images of devastation after children's hospital… +1 video,""В Минобороны назвали """"авиаудар"""" по Мариуполю срежиссированной провокацией"",Пострадавшая в Мариупольском роддоме +4 photos,Фейк: Российская авиация нанесла удар по роддому в Мариуполе + 3 photos,3 tweets: FM #Lavrov on the #Mariupol attack: The maternity house was long non-operational... + 4 photos,""«Больше недели им не продержаться» Жители Мариуполя — о гуманитарной катастрофе, которая разворачивается у них на глазах"",""Pregnant woman, baby die after Russian bombing in Mariupol"",#Ukraine Pregnant woman evacuated from hospital + 1 screenshot and a link,Та самая девушка… + 1 video,""Interview with a girl from the Mariupol: the truth about explosion, Associated Press journalist + 1 video"",Here is raw and previously unpublished shots… +1 video,The Russians were hunting us down: the war on journalism in Mariupol,Известная модель сыграла жертву для фотографа в «разбомбленной Россией» больнице Мариуполя,Зеленский использовал беременную модель для фейка о бомбежке Мариуполя,""Как я уже говорила, до того как попасть в объектив журналистов Associated Press…"",Еще немного о двойных стандартах…,4 tweets: NEW: Twitter has removed content from Russian Embassy UK… +4 screenshots,Marianna Vyshemirsky: 'My picture was used to spread lies about the war',Неужели Украина действительно «сфальсифицировала» репортаж об обстреле роддома в Мариуполе?

Russia issues first conviction for spreading 'fake news',"Pyotr Mylnikov is an admin of a Viber chat called I Live in Rubble, dedicated to the problems of his village in the Chita region. He was charged with distributing fake information about the Russian army for two messages posted in that chat. The court imposed a fine of 1m roubles ($16k), and it was the first sentence under this new article.
On March 5, shortly after the full-fledged invasion of Ukraine, Russia passed a law expanding its criminal code to penalize anyone found guilty of knowingly spreading false information about Russia's armed forces (Criminal Code, art. 207.3). In the first seven months of the war, criminal cases under this article were filed against 108 people. Some of them are influential figures such as politicians and journalists. Others are ordinary people with a small online following. These cases concern both online and offline actions, but primarily online.   
Pyotr Mylnikov was one of the first people charged under this law and the first to be sentenced. According to Mylnikov, he was found guilty of posting two documents, both allegedly created by the Russian Ministry of Defense and circulated on the internet. The first document conveyed that the bodies of those who died during the war in Ukraine would be burned. The second document revealed the plan to recruit to combat the most ideologically committed boys from the Yunarmy (the Young Army Cadets National Movement) as soon as they turned 18.","This is a measure of war censorship.

Apagones de internet durante el paro indígena del octubre 2019,"En octubre del 2019 ocurrieron protestas contra el gobierno de Lenin Moreno, principalmente, del movimiento indígena ecuatoriano.

Internet connectivity was partially restored in the afternoon but continued to face frequent internet blackouts in the following days and months across the country with most social media platforms such as Facebook, Messenger, Twitter, and Instagram being restricted by the military authority. From 15th February to 30th April 2021, a curfew-style internet cut-off was imposed every night from 1 AM to 9 PM.  Fixed internet wireless was suspended starting from 2nd April 2021 to until wireless internet was restored on 6 May 2021 for banking, commercial and financial applications. These telecommunication shutdowns and restrictions are the military's attempt to suppress a series of protests against the military uprising. 

While the internet was restored in commercial cities of the country, albeit with limitations, most conflicted affected areas in Myanmar have continued to experience complete internet blackouts until today with every little means to access reliable information and political news. It was reported that at least 54 of 330 townships in Myanmar are affected by internet blackouts at present.

China detained 897 people within the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic for their online speech or information-sharing,"In June 2020, Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) released a report about human rights violations in China during the earliest times of COVID-19. According to the report, the Chinese government detained 897 people within the first two months of the pandemic for sharing information, their opinions, and criticism about the COVID-19 pandemic on online platforms from January 1 to March 26, 2020. Among detainees, there have been Chinese journalists, such as Chen Qiushi, Fang Bin, and Li Zehua. 

The report also indicated that the number of detainees could be higher than 897 for two reasons. First, the families of many detainees avoided sharing information because they were afraid of the Chinese government's reaction. Therefore, there could be more detainees whose information could not be identified by CHRD. Secondly, the government detained many people, who criticized the Chinese government's pandemic policies, under the pretext of mandatory quarantine. Therefore, there could be more detainees who had been forcibly held by the Chinese government.","According to the report, the Chinese authorities detained online platform users under the guise of ""spreading rumors"" about the government's COVID-19 policies, ""fabricating false information"" about the pandemic, and ""causing panic"" among Chinese citizens by misleading them through disinformation.

Along with the government's claims about the detainees, it is important to remember that the Chinese government has been detaining people because of telling the truth about the pandemic since the earliest case of COVID-19 was announced by doctors who the government also detained. Therefore, although the government detained people due to the so-called reasons mentioned above, it is evident that the government uses those reasons as an excuse to prevent people from criticizing the government online and punishing them for their anti-government attitudes.","COVID-19 has accelerated techno-authoritarianism,Governments are entitled to take extreme measures to fight mis/disinformation online,Governments must monitor media and social media to ensure political stability and public safety",Governments have the right to restrict freedoms during public health emergencies,China (and Hong Kong),10 Haziran 2020,"Service interruptions,Privacy violations,Freedom of information,Disinformation and misinformation,Surveillance,Freedom of expression","Access,Data Governance,Speech,Information,Data Governance,Speech","COVID-19 and China’s Deep Digital Authoritarianism,""Digital authoritarianism, China, and COVID"",Covid-19 is Proving a Boon for Digital Authoritarianism,The Pandemic's Digital Shadow,COVID-19 Intensifies Digital Repression in South and Southeast Asia,China’s Orwellian digital surveillance turns to Olympic athletes,China’s Techno-Authoritarianism Has Gone Global,Four Takeaways From a Times Investigation Into China’s Expanding Surveillance State; Visual Investigations,China Seen Backing ‘Digital Authoritarianism’ in Latin America ",,State authority,The Chinese government and police,"Through the end of 2019, some local news agencies in China announced that several doctors had been detained by the government for spreading false claims about a new type of contagious disease and spreading fear among people. While the coronavirus spread over the world in the meantime, the Chinese government had been harshly criticized for hiding the truth about COVID-19, detaining the doctors who detected this new type of virus, and causing a global pandemic. Since that time, the Chinese government has been trying to silence any critical voices in the country.

Twitter restricts a Turkish journalist's account that is known for exposing governmental corruption,"Metin Cihan is a Turkish journalist who has long been engaged in exposing the corruption of certain government officials. On July 17, 2022, Twitter restricted his account on the grounds that the journalist had shared private information. However, none of the information shared by Cihan was private. In his tweets, Cihan exposed businesses, names, affiliations, bank account information and tenders related to the 'Canikli Files' — named after politician Nurettin Canikli — who has been involved in far-reaching corruption. 

Cihan's Twitter account was restored but the journalist has expressed concerns that it might be restricted again, given this was not the first time his account was targeted. In a video shared by Cihan on Instagram after his Twitter account was restricted, he said, in all likelihood, the restriction was caused by Canikli. His account was reported to the platform on the grounds of ""legally obtaining or giving personal data"".","In the broader context of Turkey's crackdown on media freedom and freedom of information, this incident is yet another example of how far the state is willing to go to silence independent journalism.

At the time, Twitter may not have completely envisaged how the tool would be abused by a number of increasingly authoritarian countries (including Turkey) where the authorities have targeted social media platforms in the face of growing censorship and a crackdown on freedom of expression.

In fact, one of the Turkish government’s tactics to silence users on the internet and deny them their rights to access and impart information is by submitting requests to Twitter and other platforms to withhold content deemed in violation of its local laws.

","I [wrote](https://globalvoices.org/2019/08/12/withheld-in-turkey-how-the-government-exploits-removal-requests-to-silence-critical-and-independent-voices) about this for GV last year, so going to use that work to explain a bit further: 

The Turkish government repeatedly refers to domestic legislation such as Law No.5651 and others to request platforms to carry out censorship on their behalf, and to block them when they do not comply.

In fact, under Law No.5651, hosting companies are required to take down illegal or infringing content once served with a notice from the authorities. However, what counts as illegal content in Turkey includes speech that is protected under international human rights standards. For example, law No. 5651 prohibits the defamation of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the Turkish Republic. Article 301 of the Penal Code contains provisions prohibiting the “denigration of the Turkish nation” and state institutions such as the parliament and the government. Article 299 of the same code prohibits insults against the President.

In addition, the list of government and judicial institutions with power vested in them to request blocking through court order or directly is extensive. These include the criminal judgeships of peace who have the power to order the removal of content and the closure of websites under No. 5651 and law No. 5846 on Intellectual and Artistic Works. Other bodies such as the Information and Communication Technologies Authority (ICTA), which is the telecommunications industry regulator, the Access Providers Union established in February 2014 and the Information Technologies and Communication Board can issue administrative censorship decisions under certain circumstances.

Overall, the implications of these platforms’ compliance with government requests are detrimental to freedom of expression and press freedom.

So the tactics used are quite diverse; not only is Cihan facing additional charges, but he also had to deal with a suspended Twitter account.

Popular Rwandan Government Critic on YouTube sentenced to 15 years,"A popular Rwandan critic of the President Paul Kagame regime, who usually broadcasted her dissenting views via YouTube, was found guilty by a Rwandan court of inciting violence and sentenced to 15 years in prison on September 30, 2021. Yvonne Idamange Iryamugwiza, whose YouTube channel, Idamange has a following of 19.000 subscribers, was sentenced to a lengthy prison sentence after calling out, what she termed Kagame's dictatorial leadership, his use of the 1994 Hutu-Tutsi genocide as political capital and converting the genocide memorial into a tourist site. Idamange boycotted the trial in protest over the court's refusal of a live broadcast of the proceedings and was eventually sentenced in absentia. 
She was also accused of assaulting and injuring a police officer during her arrest.
The incident attracted international outrage as it reflects the Kagame regime's strong intolerance for dissenting views and freedom of expression.","The state is cracking down on voices of dissent in order to send a chilling message to like minded critics of the regime, that they face the same fate or worse. It is a calculated intimidation tactic of using the law as a weapon to crackdown on citizens who criticize the government and it is hoped that using this method will quell any prospects of a mass uprising.

When Idamange was arrested on the 15th of February, the Rwandan Police pointed out that she had exhibited behavior ""that mixes politics, criminality, and madness"" in her use of media platforms. This narrative thread runs throughout most of the regime's justification for clamping down on voices critical of the regime and is basically a psychological operation aimed at discrediting alternative voices.

It can be inferred that the government increasingly became concerned that Idamange appeared to give a voice to the voiceless citizens of Rwanda, and that her following on YouTube was growing. Such a scenario is untenable for any authoritarian regime which aims to control public sentiment and behavior. The regime seemed shaken by the prospect of a popular uprising by citizens, as her posts apparently set in motion a movement which made public the gross failures, totalitarian tendencies and inimical policies of the Kagame led government.

The government was also shaken by Idamange's public expose's of corruption, assassination of high profile figures including the death of a music star in state detention, as well as systematic torture and forced disappearances of critics of the regime through her YouTube channel. Arresting Idamange seemed the best option to thwart critical views.","Anybody critical of the state is the state's enemy,Governments must monitor media and social media to ensure political stability and public safety,National security and sovereignty trump human rights",States should not crack down on dissent and criticism,Rwanda,30 Eylül 2021,Freedom of expression,Speech,"""A tweet by government spokesperson Yolande Makolo justifying the lengthy imprisonment of popular YouTube activist, Yvonne Idamange"",""A tweet about the suspicious death of a journalist, who was critical of the Rwandan government"",A tweet by the Rwanda Investigation Bureau (RIB) announcing the arrest of a government critic on genocide denial charges.,A tweet by a Rwandan state affiliated newspaper arguing that freedom of speech and expression is not absolute and carries with it certain penalties.,A Tweet encouraging a critical look at the 1994 genocide; a contentious topic surrounding freedom of expression in Rwanda.,A tweet by the Rwandan Presidency office quoting President Paul Kagame downplaying rights critics and lauding the country’s economic growth.,A tweet by President Kagame calling on human rights critics to give the regime a break and allow Rwanda to progress as it wishes.,A citizen tweet about the sentencing of journalist Niyonsenga Dieudonne to a 7 year prison term on various charges,A tweet on the government’s perspective with regard to freedom of expression in Rwanda,A tweet announcing that Rwandan authorities have temporarily suspended registration of YouTube content creators.,A Facebook post highlighting a December 2019 court decision upholding the conviction of two Rwandan military officers over criticism of government policies.,A tweet by the Rwandan Embassy to the United Kingdom portraying Rwanda as a media and free expression tolerant nation.,A tweet by the High Commissioner for Rwanda to the United Kingdom criticizing genocide denial by a rights activist and lawyer,A tweet by the Rwandan Investigations Bureau confirming the arrest of a journalist for spreading falsehoods online,A tweet about a harsh prison sentence handed down to a Rwandan opposition politician for spreading falsehoods and harmful propaganda,Rwandan Government in 'talks' with platforms to block genocide denial online content",,State authority,Government of Rwanda,"The use of the judiciary to clamp down on voices critical of the regime.

","Monitoring and policing social media is of paramount importance in order to maintain political stability in the country. Voices of dissent are deemed insane and subjected to grueling physical and legal punishment so as to deter like minded citizens.

Discussing the 1994 Hutu-Tutsi genocide, in a manner deemed critical of the government is subversive and likely to cause political disorder. Only the state narrative of national healing and reconciliation is acceptable. A legal approach of imprisoning genocide discourse, which is unpalatable to the regime is the method deemed justifiable.

",,"Yvonne Idamange was charged with spreading false rumors, genocide denial, inciting public unrest and assault among other charges. In her defence, she argued that she was depressed due to the stern COVID-19 lockdown measures implemented by the government. Prosecutors put it that Idamange had accused the Rwandan government of using COVID-19 lockdown measures as a tool for repression of citizens and that she had accused the state of turning genocide memorial sites into tourist sites.
The political and legal issues arising out of Idamange's indictment are fairly specific in scope, presenting opportunity for further legal challenge:
1. There is a contradiction in terms of freedom of speech provided for in the constitution, in that Article 9 states that the State commits itself to 'fighting the ideology of genocide and all its manifestations.' Article 13 provides that 'Revisionism, negationism and trivialisation of genocide are punishable by the Law.' These provisions remain ambiguous and open to political abuse in clamping down on free expression clearly provided for in Article 33 and Article 34 which provide for freedom of thought and opinion and freedom of the media and information respectively. It remains that the Rwandan government has arbitrarily used these genocide laws, which are arguably open to broad interpretation to silence dissenting voices. There is need for continued legal engagement on this political and legal conundrum.
2. Idamange's defence attorney argued that she was merely expressing herself in the exercise of her constitutional rights when she posted the video on YouTube. The Prosecution was challenged to produce evidence of victims of the broadcast to which none has been availed. Idamange's incarceration is evidently more political than criminal in nature and reflects digital authoritarianism at its extremes. This aspect also presents opportunity for legal appeal of Idamange's imprisonment.
3. Article 204 of the Rwandan Penal Code provides for a minimum of 10 years and maximum of 15 years imprisonment for offences related to inciting public insurrection. The prosecution failed to prove or provide tangible evidence that Idamange's statements would cause public unrest, as what she said was nothing new in public discourse. Rather the state used inference and preventive prosecution. This scenario effectively presents [the failure to distinguish](https://www.therwandan.com/legal-and-political-issues-arising-from-incrimination-of-idamange-iryamugwiza-yvonne/) between political statements and criminal offences, the latter of which have been used by authoritarian regimes to crack down on dissenting voices. This aspect provides room for legal contestation of Idamange's charge of inciting public violence as the charges remain vague and vexatious. 
","The inconsistency of the legal persecution of Idamange leaves room for advocacy in presenting the facts and circumstances surrounding her YouTube broadcasts.
There is need for media-related lobbying for her release including writing well-researched articles, highlighting the deficiencies of the prosecution in seeking to imprison Idamange. The articles should ideally explain how deeply embedded the Executive is in influencing the judiciary and its judgments in matters related to criticism of the regime and dissemination of counter-state narratives on matters of public interest. 
There is need to engage regional and international rights groups to continue raising the plight of Idamange who is a victim of a regime bent on shutting down free expression both online and offline. Such groups include but are not limited to Amnesty International, the International Service for Human Rights, Access Now, Human Rights Watch, and the Office of the United Nations among others.

Kyrgyzstan: Mass detention of critics who protested on social media against the controversial border deal with Uzbekistan,"A series of detentions occurred in Kyrgyzstan against civil society activists, ex-politicians and acting politicians between 23-27th October 2022. In total, 27 people were arrested and detained for two months before their trial, including six women, some with minor children. The critics publicly spoke against the handover of the Kempir-Abad water reservoir to Uzbekistan as a border deal agreement between the two countries through their social media channels and during the public assembly (Kurultai) organized in Özgön on October 15th. Most of the detained activists were members of the Committee to save Kempir-Abad, which was formed after the public assembly. The members of the Committee declared their intention to hold a nationwide public meeting on October 26th in the capital Bishkek on the issue of the water reservoir. The detainees are accused of alleged mass riot organization attempts after the security forces released three audio conversations between some of the organizers, allegedly about a planned power overthrow. According to the Criminal Code, the punishment can reach up to 10 years of imprisonment. The regime is watching (conducting surveillance), monitoring social media and punishing regime critics.          ","Bearing in mind the volatile political context of the country in the past (three power overthrows since independence in 1991), the incumbent regime is afraid that the Kempir-Abad water reservoir border deal can lead to mass riots and put an end to their rule. This has been exacerbated by the failure of the government to protect citizens during the violent Tajik military aggression in the Batken and Osh oblasts in September 2022. The political opposition and civic activists nationwide have managed to unite by establishing the Committee to save Kempir-Abad and could possibly become a major challenging force with major public support.","Foreign-funded NGOs and media outlets are a threat to the country,Civil society activists and pro-Western media are fomenting political instability,Freedom of expression is not an absolute right","Citizens should be able to access information on state projects,Surveillance of citizens violates their fundamental rights ,The state uses the label 'foreign agent' to discredit independent media outlets,Under no circumstances should the state be able to jail journalists",Kyrgyzstan,23 Ekim 2022,"Privacy violations,Freedom of information,Disinformation and misinformation,Surveillance,Coordinated inauthentic behavior and influence campaigns,Freedom of opinion,Freedom of expression","Data Governance,Speech,Information,Data Governance,Information,Speech,Speech","Кемпир-Абад: Суунун чеги суроо жаратууда,Атыр Абдрахматова призвала власти прекратить запугивать активистов и журналистов,""REакция 5.0.

Kenyan Government rolls out a Device Management System capable of nationwide communications surveillance,"On various dates in January 2017, the Kenyan Government, through its Communications Authority, contracted the country's three major mobile network operators to implement the Device Management System (DMS). The action would involve installing a communication surveillance system across mobile networks that would reportedly allow unbridled access to mobile subscriber information. DMS presents a dangerous surveillance tool as it can spy on subscribers' calls and texts and review mobile money transactions. Further, this data would be available to be cross-referenced by other state agencies and would be available to third parties. 

On 19th April 2020, this was halted through a constitutional petition filed by civil society actors, which succeeded on the grounds of privacy violations and a lack of public participation. However, just a few days later, on 24th April 2020, this decision was set aside by Kenya's Court of Appeal, which permitted the implementation of DMS. 

The same civil society actors have now approached the Supreme Court to appeal the Court of Appeal's decision. However, the position remains that the implementation of DMS is permitted. ","The justification provided by the state through the Communications Authority was national security concerns, specifically, the system was to be introduced with the primary intention of curbing the use of counterfeit and illegal mobile phones in the country. 
However, the true motives of the state are better anticipated when we look at the implementation of a Device Management System (DMS) as a part of a bigger communications surveillance conspiracy by the Kenyan government. As the country has advanced in terms of internet and mobile phone connectivity, a concerning trend of communications surveillance has been observed. According to an investigative report by Privacy International, this trend features ""intercepted communications content and data are used to facilitate gross human rights abuses, to spy on, profile, locate, track — and ultimately arrest, torture, kill or disappear suspects.""
It can be said that the question of why the Kenyan government wants to surveil mobile network communication across the country, does not have a definite answer, however, considering the above trend and the authoritarian notoriety of the Kenyan government, we can anticipate that the implementation of a DMS is part of a larger web of state surveillance purposed to establish authoritarian control over the Kenyan people.

Kazakhstan: Allegations of Pro-Tokayev coordinated inauthentic behaviour in the lead-up to 2022 Presidential elections,"During the leadership of former president Nursultan Nazarbayev, the presence of 'nurbots' was widely acknowledged in local civic discourse. 

These internet bots were paid by an agency to post content and comments that were favourable to the regime online and on social media platforms. In the lead-up to the snap presidential elections of 2022, some critics and activists alleged that President Tokayev was employing a similar strategy, as characterised by a rising amount of content that praised him and presented him as the only true leader for the country. Some have shared screenshots of private communication indicating that users have been given pre-approved content to spread en masse, with anecdotal evidence that social media campaigns were ramped up by the pro-state apparatus in the build-up to the elections. 

Another discourse surrounding bots consists of a frequently used argument by Tokayev who alleges that the country's cyberspace and his regime are under attack by foreign actors trying to destabilise Kazakhstan. Facebook's Quarter 3 'Adversarial Threat Report' for 2022 also confirms a US-origin network operating in Kazakhstan, among other countries, was banned on Meta platforms after violating its policies on coordinated inauthentic behaviour.

Theis activity is believed to happen in suburban areas and villages of Kazakhstan. Fake accounts spread regime-praising comments on social media and feedback in media articles that are relevant to the current political agenda. These accounts imitate social consent to claim the president's rule is based on people's will.

The items linked to this incident provide context about the country's history with coordinated inauthentic behaviour, the general climate leading up to the elections of 2022, and examples and allegations of non-organic image promotion on social media.","The main motive behind these alleged pro-government influence campaigns is to increase the media visibility of the president, increase support for his reforms, and provide the basis for popular legitimacy when it comes to the statistics of public opinion.

Kyrgyzstan: Ministry shuts down Azattyk-RFE/RL's website for two months,"Azattyk-RFE/RL's website was shut for two months after the Ministry of Culture, Information, Sport and Youth of the Kyrgyz Republic issued a decision on October 26th 2022. The ministry stated that the RFE/RL-affiliated “Nastoyashee Vremya” (Current Time) channel, during its airing, disseminated unconfirmed information related to the Kyrgyz and Tajik clashes in Batken oblast in September 2022. The Ministry stated that the channel was not impartial and had taken the Tajik side when reporting the news. 

The termination of the media outlet’s website was possible due to the so-called law against fake news (the Law on Protection from False Information). According to some activists, the real reason for the closure was the investigative material published by Azattyk about the controversial Kempir-Abad water reservoir issue. The investigation provided details on the border deal and shared historic facts about the Kempir-Abad reservoir’s foundation, and amplified local voices on how the decision might impact the daily lives of local residents. On October 31 2022, Azattyk’s bank accounts were frozen based on an order from the State Committee on the National Security of the Kyrgyz Republic. 
On 26 December 2022, the closure of the media outlet was extended by the Kyrgyz authorities who stated that access would be reinstated when the controversial material was removed from the website, which the RFE/RL viewed as pressure on media expression. ","After the rise of Sadyr Zhaparov to power as president, the country is moving towards authoritarianism. The government's moves indicate that it intends to take control of all media (including social media) and wants to silence critical media outlets. The number of Facebook or other social media users who are censored and interrogated by Kyrgyz security services for their criticism of the president and the incumbent government is skyrocketing. Since the beginning of 2022, dozens of bloggers have been censored and interrogated by security services for posting and re-posting material on their social media. The Kyrgyz government has become increasingly engaged in the censorship of the population’s social media posts, thereby undermining the right to freedom of expression. 

So far, the procedural changes  include the adoption of a Law against fake news in August 2021 and currently efforts are being made in order to introduce a law on foreign agents. Prior to the closure of Azattyk outlet's website, on October 13th, 2022 near the office of Azattyk in Bishkek, a group of people held a protest with banners demanding the closure of the offices of Azattyk and other critical media such as Kloop.kg and Kaktus.media. They blamed Azattyk, Kloop.kg and Kaktus.media for disinformation during the Tajik invasion of Kyrgyzstan and the June clashes in the south of Kyrgyzstan in 2010, for the promotion of political instability and non-traditional values, such as LGBT rights. The leader of the protest, Ilimbek Israilov threatened to burn down the building housing Azattyk if the Kyrgyz parliament did not adopt the Law on foreign agents, which was initiated by MP Narmatova Nadira.                ","Foreign-funded NGOs and media outlets are a threat to the country,Civil society activists and pro-Western media are fomenting political instability,Governments are entitled to take extreme measures to fight mis/disinformation online,The state respects press freedom,Governments must monitor media and social media to ensure political stability and public safety","It is the government's duty to protect journalists and ensure they can work safely,The state uses the label 'foreign agent' to discredit independent media outlets,The country's press freedom is in decline",Kyrgyzstan,26 Ekim 2022,"Freedom of information,Disinformation and misinformation,Coordinated inauthentic behavior and influence campaigns,Freedom of opinion,Freedom of expression","Speech,Information,Information,Speech,Speech","Сөз эркиндигин колдогон жөө жүрүш,Элдин үнү!,""A tweet by  Michael Carpenter, U.S. Ambassador to the OSCE"",Блокировка «Азаттык Медиа».

In the past, Azattyk's investigations (conducted together with OCCRP and Kloop) on state corruption and money laundering schemes, including one related to the deputy chief of the Kyrgyz Customs, [Matraimov](https://www.occrp.org/en/the-matraimov-kingdom/), garnered a lot of response and contributed to the October protests in 2020 which resulted in a change of power. 

Today, investigative journalism in Kyrgyzstan faces various challenges and some journalists are faced with numerous accusations, assaults, or legal proceedings. A prominent recent case was related to the head of Temirov Live, an investigative YouTube channel. Bolot Temirov, the journalist behind the channel, [was accused](https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/case/human-rights-defender-and-journalist-bolot-temirov-deported-russia) of possessing drugs, illegally acquiring of a Kyrgyz passport, and performing an illegal border crossing. However, due to public pressure,  during the public court procedure, he was found [innocent](https://rus.azattyk.org/a/32055988.html) and was released in September 2022. In early November, the state prosecutor made an [appeal](https://kloop.kg/blog/2022/11/01/prokuratura-ne-soglasna-s-opravdatelnym-prigovorom-zhurnalista-temirova-i-prosit-naznachit-nakazanie/) against the court’s decision. 

The persecution against Temirov started after his outlet published investigative materials about the head of the State Committee on National Security, Tashiev, and his family, namely materials about their state corruption [scheme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNNuPazBJ2k), state bidding with a [company](https://kloop.kg/blog/2022/04/19/temirov-live-kompaniya-taj-murasa-tashieva-vyigryvaet-tendery-na-postavku-benzina/) in state procurements, and others. Eventually, in November, Temirov was expelled from Kyrgyzstan by a court decision. 

The authorities also intend to adopt a law on foreign agents (which is currently under public consideration). These steps put at risk the country's freedom of the press and opinion and limit the activity of civil society and non-state organizations in Kyrgyzstan. Finally, in January 2023, the Apparatus of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic released a draft [law on Mass Media](https://rus.azattyk.org/a/32230108.html) according to which the state will control bloggers, internet outlets and social media accounts with more than 5K followers. The state will register them in a centralized registry and will keep them [accountable](https://rus.azattyk.org/a/32228444.html), making it easier to prosecute bloggers. This is done in order to mute criticism against the incumbent regime.                     
","Information manipulation,Technology controls,Freedom restrictions,Internet controls",Internet access restrictions,Public digital surveillance,"Influence campaign,Disinformation,Information ecosystem shaping",Tech service and platform blocking,Media,N/A,N/A,,,"Ordinary citizens are harmed because their rights to access information are limited due to the website's closure. Azattyk-affiliated journalists, other independent journalists, and other independent media outlets (such as Kloop and Kaktus.media) are harmed because they are maligned to the public by the government as 'evil-doers' and 'promoters of instability'. They are framed by state narratives (through social media influencing and state propaganda) as ‘foreign agents’, who are pro-Western. 

This negative labeling also worsens the image of the non-state organizations functioning in the country who are also blamed for their 'service' to the west. Due to this narrative, the state is currently pushing forward a law on 'foreign agents' which currently is under public discussion. 

Before the closure of Azattyk’s website, there was a protest by 'pro-government activists' in Bishkek in front of the media outlet's office building. About 20-30 people gathered with banners stating that Azattyk and other foreign-funded media, such as Kloop and Kaktus.kg, should be banned. The banners also stated that NGOs should also be controlled by the state because they are funded by the west. 

The analysis of pro-regime media items, including posts on the social media channels of the incumbent president’s support groups, illustrate how these channels are being used to support the narratives that ‘civil society activists and pro-Western media are fomenting political instability’ and ‘foreign-funded NGOs and media outlets are a threat to the country’. The Instagram posts of Zhaparov’s support group blame these media outlets for their destructive work within the country, stating that they are working to make Kyrgyzstan a failed and poor state that is dependent on western countries.

Chinese government denounces Hong Kong media survey where respondents express concern about digital surveillance,"On 5 November 2021, the Foreign Correspondents' Club (FCC) in Hong Kong issued the results of a recent survey among its members regarding the work environment for journalists in Hong Kong since the implementation of the National Security law in June 2020. The findings suggested a perceived deterioration of media freedoms in Hong Kong and a majority of respondents (journalists based in Hong Kong) expressed concern about digital surveillance. 37% had deleted images, either online or on their devices. A few hours after the results were released on the website of the FCC, the spokesperson of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China issued a strongly worded response which referred to the survey as misleading, not representative and not credible. It further accused the FCC of interfering in Hong Kong affairs. 

Before that, the Hong Kong and Chinese governments maintained a narrative that the 2019 protests were mainly instigated and funded by foreign forces. In this context, foreign media has become a frequent target and is sometimes accused of smearing local authorities and interfering with domestic affairs. 

In 2018, authorities harshly criticized the FCC for organizing a talk with a pro-independence activist, questioning if the Club should be allowed to continue the lease of its current premises.

Online media platform Stand News was raided by Hong Kong Police Force,"On 29 December 2021, the online media platform Stand News was raided by the National Security Department of the Hong Kong police force. Six persons were arrested and detained. At the end of that day, Stand News ceased all operations and removed its website content. One day later, its UK branch was shut down as well. While the organization was not directly forced to shut down by authorities (it closed down ""voluntarily""), this decision came amidst high-profile arrests (and the subsequent closure) targeting the popular opposition news outlet, Apple Daily, which had been raided earlier that year. A few days after the closure of Stand News, another online media platform, Citizen News, announced its dissolution, citing the risk to its employees. 
The National Security Law was implemented in June 2020, in response to the social unrest that unfolded in Hong Kong between June and December 2019. The law was introduced as a constitutional annexe, and was directly imposed by the Central Government in Beijing. Given the impact on three leading media organizations, the law significantly impacted online and offline media freedoms in Hong Kong.",The media outlet in question is accused of having breached the law by publishing seditious content.,"Left-leaning/liberal media are anti-national,The rule of law is alive and well in Hong Kong,Freedom of expression is not an absolute right,Foreign-funded NGOs and media outlets are a threat to the country,Journalists who criticize the government are enemies of the state,National security and sovereignty trump human rights,The state respects press freedom,Western media are seeking to destroy the reputations of non-Western nations","The country's press freedom is in decline,States should not crack down on dissent and criticism",China (and Hong Kong),29 Aralık 2021,"Freedom of information,Disinformation and misinformation,Freedom of expression","Speech,Information,Speech","Former HK leader CY Leung says it is not necessary for the National Security law to have clear red lines ,""Hong Kong’s Stand News shuts down after national security police arrest 7, freeze HK$61 million in assets"",The insufferable hypocrisy of Western governments hell-bent on destroying Julian Assange,Exiled activist Nathan Law comments on state of Hong Kong journalism after Stand News demise ,Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen expresses concerns about Hong Kong press freedom,煽動苛法無邊 傳媒岌岌可危,《立場》案開審　控方：文章反映煽動行為,香港人：請臺灣朋友珍惜你們現在的民主自由,Hong Kong has gone from being one of Asia's most free-wheeling media markets to one of its most regulated,""Stand News comes to an end, as ‘no place’ for anti-China tool in name of free press"",Some Hong Kong media didn't leave the sinking ship,Hong Kong chief secretary sends complaint letter to Wall Street Journal,No one is safe in Hong Kong,Hospital Labour Union ridicules pro-government figure after Stand News closure,It is unfair to blame the Hong Kong government for the closure",,State authority,National Security Department of the Hong Kong Police Force ,"The police raided the offices of Stand News, arrested six persons, and confiscated documents and computer devices.

Kenya's ruling party registered citizens as members without their knowledge and consent,"In the months leading up to the August 2022 Kenyan elections, the ruling party, Jubilee, along with the other primary political parties, was implicated in the illegal mass registration of citizens. This is said to have been done through the Office of the Registrar of Political Parties which is the state agency that keeps and maintains political party membership records. This constituted an egregious breach of privacy that features both unauthorised access and misuse of the personal information of Kenyans, including their signatures, in a clear effort to advance certain political aims. It is further worth noting that this is not the first time Kenyans have been fraudulently registered to political parties. 

A Tweet on 18 June 2021 raised the alarm that one Twitter user had been registered to the Jubilee party without his knowledge or consent. This was followed by concerned Kenyans checking their registration status on the online e-citizen platform (which is the digital platform used to access government services in Kenya). Most of them were shocked to find out that they were registered as belonging to political parties they did not subscribe to. Many took to social media to express their shock and anger. From the social media reports, it was apparent that of all the political parties implicated, most people were fraudulently registered to the ruling Jubilee Party. Some Kenyans reported this to the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner which reported having received over 200 complaints. 

Following the uproar on Twitter, the Office of the Registrar of Political Parties (ORPP) distanced itself from the incident. Totally denying the possibility of a data privacy breach or misuse of citizens' personal data, the state agency called it a mere mishap due to the fact that they were in the pilot stage of the process of digitizing the political parties' membership registry and integrating it with the e-citizen platform. Further, the state agency, through its then director, stated that this might be the fault of Kenyans who could have forgotten that they had registered for certain political parties. The explanations provided, however, do not hold much water as some citizens reported having been registered as members of political parties years before some of these parties were even formed. This was the case for several of those registered under the Jubilee Party. Eventually, following social media pressure, the ORPP committed to a de-registration process for those aggrieved and stated the intention to hold the implicated political parties accountable, but no such action was ever taken by the state agency. 

The Jubilee Party, like the other implicated political parties, remained silent on the issue. The party did not state its motivations or justifications for this incident. However, considering the history of this and similar incidents and the fact that they always precede an election year, there is no other conclusion other than that the intentions were to commit some kind of electoral interference or fraud. This argument is further supported by the fact that prior to the August 2022 polls, the ORPP reported discrepancies in the numbers of registered voters and political party membership numbers. ","None of the political parties spoke on this, therefore their motive remains unclear. However, it can be anticipated that this was done in an effort to increase the number of members registered with the Jubilee party, most probably in an effort to facilitate some kind of unfair advantage for the Jubilee Party in the upcoming 2022 elections.","The state is committed to respecting privacy and protecting citizens' data,Data breaches are an unavoidable part of the process of digitizing government systems or services","Data privacy breaches undermine the democratic process,State authorities do not care about citizens' privacy,The private sector should not be given access to citizens' data,Data protection acts are vital for democracy,The state must act immediately to prevent future data breaches ,Involuntary registration of citizens by political parties is a violation of their rights",Kenya,18 Haziran 2021,Privacy violations,Data Governance,"Political Parties Registered Kenyans as Members Without Their Consent,ORPP To Deregister People Illegally Listed as Members of Political Parties ,Reports of Kenyans illegally registered as members of a political party without their consent emerge,A tweet challenging the fraudulent registration of Kenyans to political parties without their knowledge and consent ,Kenyans protest registration as party members without consent,A tweet by Raila Odinga Junior informing his followers that he was fraudulently registered to a political party without his consent.,Kenyans Can Sue Political Parties For Illegal Registrations,""Why three want Jubilee, UDA, Farmer's Party Deregistered"",Government issues statement on registration of Kenyans to ‘wrong’ political parties,Kenyans Anxious Of 2022 Election Fraud After Unlawful Registration To Political Parties,A tweet asking Kenyan Twitter users whether they have been fraudulently registered to the Ruling Jubilee party ,A tweet calling for state accountability over the unlawful registration of Kenyans to political parties without their consent,A tweet by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner of Kenya addressing the unlawful registration of Kenyans to political parties,A tweet reporting on the fraudulent registration of Kenyans to political parties without their consent,A tweet issuing Amnesty International (K) statement against the fraudulent registration of Kenyans to political parties without their consent. ,A tweet by a renowned journalist raising alarm over the discovery of his personal details being fraudulently registered with the ruling Jubilee Party membership.

Cameroon journalist jailed for reports and social media posts about the ongoing Anglophone Conflict ,"Journalist Njoka Kingsley is languishing at the Yaounde Kondengui Prison under charges of 'terrorism'. At the time of arrest, he was accused of sponsoring armed groups who provided information for his reports and social media posts. He was a freelance journalist and contributed to a programme in one of Cameroon's local TV stations, CANAL 2, and L'Effort Camerounaise, a Catholic newspaper. 

According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Njoka Kingsley said he left the Northwest region'a conflict hotspot because he was being targeted by state authorities. This was because his reports were providing information and updates on the Anglophone conflict, a six-year crisis that is being fought largely between separatist fighters and the Cameroonian military. 

Kingsley Njoka is not a prominent journalist, but as has been routine for the government, he is among the journalists who have been jailed for reporting about the Anglophone conflict. The case of journalist Mimi Mefo who was jailed for her reporting, which the government tagged as propagating fake news on the conflict, is a glaring example. When released, she had to flee the country to Germany, from where she now reports. Another example is the arrest of Samuel Wazizi (a journalist accused of supporting separatists) who died in jail. His remains have, till today (January 2023), not been given to his family. Many Anglophone journalists quit their jobs or self-censor, in fear for their lives.

It should be noted that since 2016, the Anglophone crisis, which largely laid dormant over the years, took a different dimension. It stems from the grievance of the English-speaking regions that they have been marginalized by the French-speaking majority. Cameroon is made up of 20 per cent Anglophones and 80 per cent Francophones. The two sides, initially partitioned between the British and French, came together as the United Republic of Cameroon. But over the years, the terms of unity gradually eroded. Eventually, separatist tendencies took over and the conflict turned into an armed conflict and is ongoing to date. Today, government forces are fighting armed groups in the Anglophone regions. ","The government does not want to attract international attention as they have claimed there is no problem. Allowing journalists to relate what is happening to the outside world would be bad for the image of the country.  The government justifies the arrest as trying to safeguard territorial integrity, public peace, and security.

In Kazakhstan: dissident arrested and charged with spreading 'false information' on social media,"On February 26, 2022, the Kazakh opposition leader Zhanbolat Mamay was arrested for organizing a rally in memory of the January protests' victims a month earlier. He was subsequently rearrested on two new criminal charges. One of them was for insulting law enforcement officers and the second was for distributing 'false information' after he broadcast meetings with government officials on his social media. In sum, he has been accused of spreading disinformation and organising mass protests (Criminal Code 272), ""propaganda of destructive attitudes, contributing to the growth of protest activism"".

Human rights organizations and independent journalists believe his detention and trial are politically motivated. The case of Mamay exemplifies the nature of digital authoritarianism in Kazakhstan during the political transition from president Nazarbayev to Tokayev. 

Mamay's arrests came in the aftermath of the January 2022 protests that were marked by unprecedented violence and national riots. What started as peaceful protests against rising gas prices in Western Kazakhstan took a violent turn and shook the country. The protests are referred to as Qandy Qantar or Bloody January. Access to the internet and social media was blocked during the protests by the government in an attempt to control information flow. State-owned media monopolised the coverage of the January protests, spreading the ruling regime's position, arguing that foreign actors had infiltrated the protest groups and were trying to destabilise the country. Opposition and independent journalists sharing their views about the January protests on social media were accused of spreading disinformation and endangering state security. 

It was the context of Bloody January that enabled the government to crack down so harshly on Mamay. Therefore, to place the arrest within a broader context, the harms and controls described below also include those leveraged by the government against other actors during the protests.",To crack down on any dissent or criticism that would threaten the legitimacy of President Tokayev's rule.,"Freedom of expression is not an absolute right,National security and sovereignty trump human rights,The law is the most effective way to clamp down on fake news","Government and state-owned media should not sponsor mis/disinformation and defamation campaigns,Governments should not politically persecute people they consider opponents/Los gobiernos no deberían cometer persecución política contra las personas que consideran opositores,States should not crack down on dissent and criticism,States should stop using crises and alleged risks to national security to justify surveillance,The government and politicians should not carry out inauthentic influence campaigns on social media",Kazakhstan,26 Şubat 2022,"Freedom of information,Legislation,Disinformation and misinformation,Surveillance,Freedom of opinion,Freedom of expression","Speech,Access,Information,Data Governance,Speech,Speech","В чем обвиняют Жанболата Мамая?,Алматыда тағы да бейбіт митинг өтеді,""Жаңа """"қаңтардың"""" иісі сезіле ме?"",International Support for Mamay and his release under house arrest,Абақтыдан хат,Inconsistency between Human Rights reforms and the detention of Zhanbolat Mamay,Политику Жанболату Мамаю переквалифицировали обвинение,Жанболат Мамай не является организатором беспорядков ,Токаев: террористы численностью 20 тыс. совершили минимум шесть волн атак в Алматы,«На площадях уже не было протестующих» Токаев,Костанайца осудили за распространение ложной информации во время январских событий,""БІЗ ҚАЗАҚСТАНДА 2022 ЖЫЛЫ ҚАЙҒЫЛЫ ОҚИҒА КЕЗІНДЕ ЗАРДАП ШЕККЕН, ҰСТАЛҒАН, ЖАРАЛАНҒАН ЖӘНЕ ҚАЗА ТАПҚАН"",Прокуратура должна провести проверку в отношении следователя по делу Мамая ,Кыргызского музыканта в Казахстане пытаются выдать за участника погромов,Сегодня День общенационального траура в Казахстане",,State authority,President Tokayev,"The January protests in 2022 in Kazakhstan enabled the government to prosecute political opposition actors, journalists and activists, justifying their actions by the need to restore public order and security.

After the escalation of riots, President Tokayev imposed a state of emergency, [explicitly](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/kazakhstan-president-shoot-kill-order-protests-violence-rcna11317) allowing security forces to ""shoot to kill"" protesters.
