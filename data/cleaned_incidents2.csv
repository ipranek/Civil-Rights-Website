The Brazilian government paid influencers to promote ineffective medication against COVID,"The Brazilian government invested more than US$268,000 in influencer marketing during the pandemic, of which around US$ 5,000 was given to a group of influencers tasked with promoting a series of pills (known in Brazil as atendimento precoce) that had been proved ineffective against COVID-19.","These pills were a crucial part of the Brazilian governments' response to the pandemic. Similar to what was seen in the United States, Bolsonaro insisted that these medications —which by then had had their efficiency debunked by science — worked to prevent and treat COVID. Scientists who became ""influent voices"" during the pandemic had been debunking the government's claims. In March 2021, a report by Agência Pública revealed that the government was using public funds to push that narrative on social media. Ultimately, the government was sponsoring misinformation.

Russia's creation of a sovereign internet,"Since 2019, Russia has intensified strategic and tactical work on creating a ""sovereign internet"", ostensibly to protect Russia's internet segment from foreign attacks, but in reality to strengthen control over Russian online communications, content, citizen data, connections and infrastructure.

"Turkey blocked access to some 467,000 websites by 2020","A recent report by the freedom of expression association EngelliWeb revealed that the Turkish government issued access bans to 467,011 websites by the end of 2020. According to the findings of the report, in addition to blocked websites, some 764 different government agencies ordered the access bans, while the local judiciary has issued more than 400k decrees for the bans. ","The motive here is to stifle freedom of information, freedom of access to information, freedom of speech and media. The ruling party often relies on its notorious Internet law 5651 which is used as a legal shield in targeting internet in Turkey. In recent years, and especially after the Gezi protests in 2013, the ruling Justice and Development has become even more intolerant to any information that is critical of government policies, exposes corruption, or anything else that the party deems as ""criticism"" or ""insult"". To put it simply, any form of criticism is subject to arbitrary punishments and the decline in overall freedoms in the country attests to this reality. ",Turkey,16 August 2021,2021
A 70-year-old man arrested for insulting the president,"Ali Yılmaz, a 70 year old man, was arrested on charges of “insulting” President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Yilmaz's crime was to repeat the proverb that journalist Sedef Kabaş said out loud during her show, for which she too was arrested (but later released) also on charges of insulting the president. Yilmaz shared the proverb in a tweet after congratulating the journalist Kabas on her release. In court, Yilmaz said he ""did not mean or had any intention to insult the head of state.""","Arresting citizens (regardless of their profession or affiliation) on charges of insulting the president are a common practice. In fact, the number of arrests specifically on this criminal offense has skyrocketed in hears after President Erdogan was elected as president (prior he served as the country's prime minister since 2003). The motive is the ruling party's and chief among them, its leader, inability to take any criticism. Hence, the growing number of arrests targeting people under ""insults"".

Court blocks access to news about suicide of a student,"Enes Kara, 19, was a second-year medical student at Elazığ Fırat University Medical Faculty. On January 11, Kara died by suicide. In a video recording that the 19-year-old left behind, he explained the unbearable compulsory indoctrination at the student housing his family sent him to live in, and the lack of hope for his future. “I have lost my entire joy for life and enthusiasm in the situation that I have found myself in,” Kara said in the video.
His video went viral on social media and reminded viewers of previous cases of violence, abuse, and murder at religious community-run student housing in recent years. 
Kara's father applied to a local court asking the court to block access to news reports of his son's suicide, on the grounds that the reports were an insult to his personal rights. The court ruled in favor of imposing access blocks on a number of news websites that published developments regarding Kara's suicide. ","Critics of the ban said the local court was covering up for the perpetrators of the crime, which included the religious dormitory and its owners as well as the responsibility of the parents who refused to hear their son's plea to move him to a different place.

The court is yet to make its decision. ","The overall motive is to silence independent media. In this case, it is an attempt to silence foreign media, but rather than blocking their original websites, the watchdog is trying to block the Turkish language services of these news platforms.

Supreme Court determines Telegram to be blocked in Brazil,"On Thursday, March 17th, 2022, a monocratic decision by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes mandated internet and data providers in Brazil to ""disable the use"" of Telegram in Brazil within 72 hours. The process was in secrecy, but it was leaked on Friday, when the country came to know about it. ","The decision was motivated by Telegram's non-compliance with previous court orders from the Supreme Court and the Supreme Electoral Court and an overall lack of cooperation with Brazilian authorities in the context of a program to fight misinformation in the 2022 Presidential Elections. Telegram also does not have a legal representative in Brazil, which has made the relationship with institutions unsustainable. 

More specifically, this decision by Justice Alexandre de Moraes was made on top of a representation by the Federal Police in the context of an investigation against far-right blogger Allan dos Santos, who is being investigated due to his involvement in a fake news scheme and the organization of anti-democratic demonstrations. The Federal Police was attempting to enforce against Telegram a court order by the Supreme Court in which the platform had to suspend Allan dos Santos from their service.

Internet disruptions on networks served by government-owned operator TelOne Recorded,"The Zimbabwe Republic Police stopped opposition party leader Nelson Chamisa from holding a rally on the 13th of March, 2022. Although the police blocked the rally from taking place, thousands of citizens took to the streets of Marondera to protest the police prohibition. Internet watchdog NetBlocks reported that there were significant disruptions on networks served by the government-owned operator TelOne. This disruption limited coverage of the protest and an anticipated political rally by the opposition leader. NetBlocks reported that data collated corroborated user reports of unexplained outages over the weekend of the planned rally, which was banned.

In total, the ministry said they have analyzed 6,362 social media accounts and deemed 855 users as ""suspicious."" 402 of these users were detained. ","The Ministry of Interior tracked users who were critical of government policies with regard to COVID 19, especially about the authorities hiding the true numbers (it turned out to be true because from March until September, people were only given information about diagnosed/symptomatic patients and only after much criticism and leaking of documents from hospitals doing tests did the real numbers begin to include/ reflect asymptomatic patients too). Mass lockdowns and few government incentives to support the public at large — especially those who were forced to stay home with no financial support or security — were common points of discussion online.

"Restrictions on the Internet, communication and movement in Jammu and Kashmir","A day before the Union government abrogated Section 370, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, it imposed restrictions on movement and connectivity.

Sexual disinformation campaigns against female journalist Hajar Raissouni,"Female journalist Hajar Raissouni, a journalist in Akhbar Al-Yum (one of the country's last independent newspapers) was arrested on charges of “illegal abortion” and “sex outside marriage” and sentenced on September 30. 2019 to a year in prison before she was released with a royal pardon. The incident sparked a storm within civil society and spurred a wide debate in the Moroccan media about freedom of the press, women’s rights, and laws that protect people’s privacy. The defamation machine was launched against Hajar by media outlets close to the authorities, such as Chouf TV and Barlamane, starting with digging into the most intimate aspects of her private life, ending with accusing her of becoming “pregnant'' by her manager, Taoufik Bouachrine, and calling for Hajar's arrest. Moroccan authorities sought to prove the charges at any cost, including forcing her to undergo a medical examination without her consent.

Bolsonaro's meeting with WhatsApps,"Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro meet with WhatsApp representatives in the Planalto Palace. According to a Folha de S.

The product is set to launch globally in September, one month before the Brazilian elections.","The motive is not 100% clear, but looking at it from an electoral perspective, we understand that WhatsApp is a very important tool for Bolsonaro's campaign due to its infrastructure. It allows information (including false and fabricated information) to spread easily and reach hundreds of thousands of people across the country, as it is present in 99% of Brazilians' phones. In 2018, it was crucial in helping him win, and is probably viewed as an important part of Bolsanaro's electoral strategy for 2022. ",Brazil,27 April 2022,2022

India directs Twitter to remove tweets critical of the government's handling of the COVID-19 crisis,"In April 2021, amidst the deadly second wave, the government sent a legal request to Twitter to take down tweets, citing a violation of the Information Technology Act 2000.

The mobile phones of 35 journalists from six media outlets were infected by this spyware from July 2020 to November 2021. The Salvadoran government denied its participation and is reluctant to investigate this case of espionage.","While the government has not acknowledged its involvement, let alone talk about motivations, there is a coincidence between the time of this espionage to several journalists coming out with investigative publications about public official corruption during the COVID-19 pandemic, and secret negotiations between the government and gangs. It is therefore possible that the state wanted to keep track of these journalists to find out who their sources were and whether they planned on releasing more damning evidence about the government.",El Salvador,13 July 2020,2020
India: Mohammed Zubair is arrested for a social media post,"On 27 June 2022, Alt-news co-founder Mohammed Zubair was arrested by the Delhi Police’s Cyber Crime Unit following a complaint made by an anonymous user with the Twitter name ‘Hanuman Bhakt’ (English translation: a devotee of the Hindu God Hanuman).  The Tweet in question used an old movie poster to make a joke about how India had changed from after 2014 (the year when Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power). In the poster, the word ""Honeymoon"" hotel has been changed to ""Hanuman hotel"" and Zubair tweeted, ""Before 2014: Honeymoon Hotel and After 2014: Hanuman Hotel"". The subtext here is that Zubair was poking fun at the prevalence of Hindutva (Hindu supremacy ideology) that has gained momentum after the BJP came to power in 2014.

The Twitter user who reported the tweet to the police officials stated that Zubair had insulted the Hindu God Hanuman by making a reference to Honeymoon, especially as Hanuman is considered to be a ""Brahmchari"" (celibate) who does not engage in sexual acts. 

Following the complaint, Zubair was charged under Section 153A and Section 295A of the Indian Penal code (IPC). Under Section 153, an individual can be charged for “promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony,” while Section 295 A penalises “deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage reli­gious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or reli­gious beliefs.” On July 2, 2022, additional charges of criminal conspiracy, causing the disappearance of evidence and violating foreign funding rules, were also filed against him by the police

In addition to the 2018 tweet case, over the next few weeks, new First Incident Reports (FIRs) were lodged for content Zubair had posted, and previous cases were investigated — essentially a legal witch hunt. Eventually, a ""Special Investigation Team"" was formed to probe six out of seven cases. On July 15, 2022, a Delhi court granted Zubair bail subject to certain conditions in the 2018 tweet case, reasoning that “The voice of dissent is necessary for a healthy democracy. Therefore, for mere criticism of any political parties it is not justified to invoke Section 153A (promoting enmity) and 295A (deliberate and malicious acts to outrage religious feelings) of the IPC.” The court also held that Zubair had not violated the foreign funding rules. However, he continued to be held in the other cases. On July 19, 2022, looking into the matter, the Supreme Court expressed concern about the “vicious cycle” of him getting bail in one case only to be held in another despite the contents of the FIRs filed being “similar” and decided to club the cases together. A day later, the SC granted him conditional bail in all cases and rejected the state government of Uttar Pradesh’s plea to stop him from tweeting. ","The exact motive is unclear as there are multiple perspectives on the issue. According to media sources, the Delhi police said, “The said post of Mohd. Zubair containing picture & words against a particular religious community are highly provocative & done deliberately which are more than sufficient to incite hatred among people which can be detrimental for maintenance of public tranquillity.” 

In another statement, reported in The Hindustan Times, a police official investigating the matter has said efforts will be made to “bust the social media brigade which Zubair has.” The official added, “It appears that his tweets are planned and pushed in a concerted manner. They are amplified by an army of people. If these are bots then who is paying these bots. We are digging deep into this network that amplifies his tweets.” 

On the other hand, press bodies such as the Editor's Guild of India, have attributed the arrest to Altnews' role in debunking mis/disinformation in the country. They call the arrest 'disturbing' in the statement and note that ""It is apparent that AltNews' alert vigilance was resented by those who use disinformation as a tool to polarise society and rake nationalist sentiments.""

Tanzania: Parliament to table proposal for data protection law,"Over the years, there have been calls by ICT stakeholders for the Tanzanian government to enact a Data Protection Act in efforts to guarantee the privacy of personal data. These calls seem to have borne fruit as the cabinet just approved a draft Data Protection Bill that was scheduled to be tabled in parliament for the first time on the 13th of September 2022. However, with the increasing number of cases where dissenting voices are being arrested and detained by the state security apparatus, it is widely feared that this proposed law will be used to crack down on people who criticize the government using online platforms. The idea behind enacting such a law is purportedly meant to protect citizens' privacy rights, yet the motive is the entrenching of digital authoritarianism, with the law being used to silence voices of dissent.","The government is seeking to regulate data on digital platforms in a bid to curb the abuse of citizens' personal liberties. There is concern over the sharing of information with third parties without the consent of users, with the ICT Minister proposing an examination of what he terms ethics of internet use 'to the extent that it is governable.' This has raised concern among civil society and other stakeholders that the proposed law must be drafted cautiously, while taking into account citizens' rights enshrined in the constitution.
Considering the government's increasingly authoritarian stance, targeting journalists, activists and voices of dissent, it is imperative to note that a swiftly-passed data protection act which fails to factor in the input of the broad range of stakeholders would be inimical to democracy in the country. The government usually passes laws which swiftly sail through parliament, where the ruling party has a majority vote. On the balance of probabilities, the government is likely interested in passing a law that would criminalize freedom of the media and freedom of speech online, as the security establishment is already clamping down on voices of dissent. In other words, the state is likely seeking a legal means to crack down on civil society activists, journalists and political opponents, who may be a thorn in the flesh of the state apparatus.",Tanzania,8 September 2022,2022
Zimbabwe Journalist Hopewell Chin’ono’s freedom bid flops again,"A Harare court, on the 22nd of June 2022, dismissed independent journalist Hopewell Chin'ono's application for removal from remand, after he was accused of having obstructed the course of justice. He is accused of tweeting statements likely to incite public violence and for obstruction of justice. He was arrested and imprisoned over both tweets in January and November 2021. The latest dismissed court case is related to Chin'ono having tweeted statements deemed to be an obstruction of public justice ahead of a judicial decision in November 2021. 
Lancelot Mutsokoti, who represented the state, had requested the court to postpone the matter to the 6th of July  2022, arguing that the docket was still in the possession of the Prosecutor-General’s Office. Only after it is released and availed by the Prosecutor-General can it be brought to court for trial.
However, the State has continually requested for postponement of the trial, citing a plethora of reasons. For instance, the State at one stage once argued that it hadn't yet received a response from Twitter's head office to verify if Chin'ono's Twitter credentials matched the credentials in the database of authorized users and the data authentication server.
Chin’ono then recommended to the court to check with the Africa Desk in Ireland, where queries from Africa are dealt with. The legal persecution of Chin'ono is ongoing and under the media spotlight.","Hopewell Chin'ono is a known government critic and investigative journalist reputed for exposing corruption and nepotism in the government. He has been a thorn in the state's efforts to cover up apparent cases of corruption and abuse of taxpayers' funds, hence his continued persecution and legal harassment would be in President Emmerson Mnangagwa's interests to intimidate other journalists from pursuing similar investigative exposes. As a whistleblowing journalist, Chin'ono published a report in 2020 exposing a COVID-19 Personal Protective Equipment procurement scandal, which led to the sacking of the then minister of Health, Obadiah Moyo. The security forces later arrested Chin'ono on allegations of incitement to cause public violence, a move described by international critics as an onslaught on press and digital freedom.",Zimbabwe,22 June 2022,2022
Zimbabwe: Cabinet resolution to introduce SMART cities traffic management system,"The government of Zimbabwe is set to introduce a SMART cities traffic management system across major urban areas of the country, according to a cabinet resolution adopted on the 17th of May, 2022. Cameras which capture the data of various persons will be installed at all major intersections and what the government terms 'strategic points' to 'gather information' and monitor traffic flow. 

The idea behind the camera rollout is to enhance operational efficiencies in law enforcement and traffic management, according to the cabinet resolution. Considering President Mnangagwa's obsession with consolidating power and keeping dissenting voices under check as part of authoritarian rule, the camera rollout is, in essence, part of the broader pervasive and panoptic surveillance measures being implemented by his administration. This ties into the key thematic area of data governance, with a particular focus on privacy and surveillance, effectively revealing digital totalitarianism in Zimbabwe.","The government led by President Emmerson Mnangagwa is exploring as many methods as possible to crack down on voices of dissent in the country, including promulgating a raft of draconian laws and the use of expensive surveillance technology. Ever since the military coup of November 2017, which deposed the late strongman Robert Mugabe, Mnangagwa has become increasingly paranoid about the prospect of being removed from power by popular protest. His regime's strategy, therefore, has been to use a specific and targeted approach to dealing with political threats through surveillance, use of spyware, isolation and arrests of perceived enemies of the state. The rollout of surveillance technology could not have come at a better time, as the country heads for elections in 2023. The main motive for the use of surveillance cameras is not for the security of the public as officially announced, but for clamping down on opposition party leaders, journalists, lawyers and other voices of dissent.",Zimbabwe,17 May 2022,2022
"Tanzania publishes EPOCA, resulting in stricter online content regulation","The Electronic and Postal Communications (SIM Card Registration) Regulations – EPOCA (the SCR Regulations) were published by the Tanzanian government in 2020. These regulations are aimed at curtailing freedom of expression online and cutting down media freedom. A number of the attached items in this analysis indicate that the government is using this law to suppress constitutionally enshrined freedom of expression and the media.
Additionally, the regulations require Tanzanian nationals and residents to register their SIM cards through a new biometric registration system launched by the Tanzania Communication Regulatory Authority (TCRA). It is important to note that the TCRA has served as a useful tool for the government to crack down on voices of dissent by summoning editors, denying license renewals and openly censuring criticism of the government.
As part of its broader efforts to encourage self-censorship and instill a sense of fear within the populace, Tanzanians are required to register with the National Identification Authority (NIDA), and share their fingerprints and documents detailing their proof of identity. Their NID/NIN (National Identification/National Identification Number) is then linked to a registered SIM card. This abrogates the government's unfettered powers to easily identify and persecute any individual who criticizes state policies or offer counter-narratives to the status quo.
Considering that Tanzania does not have any data protection legislation, it makes communication interception likely, which impedes on privacy rights. Further, state security may use this lacuna to intercept communication under the pretext of criminal investigations and or national security, yet it would be a political ruse to crack down on voices of dissent.
The widely criticized EPOCA Regulations also require that internet cafes install CCTVs on their premises, and keep a record of their internet services users (Name, ID, telephone number).","To monitor and surveil people's actions online, and ensure that they are in accordance with the law.",Tanzania,17 July 2020,2020

Investigative journalists reveal that the Hungarian government has been using Pegasus spyware on critics,"In 2018, the Hungarian government started deploying the Pegasus spyware; according to the investigative reporting done by Direkt36, it targeted approximately 300 Hungarian citizens. Many of the targets are journalists, influential business actors with control over independent media, civil society actors, and critics of the government. The government first did not admit that it bought and used the software but a few months later it did confirm the allegation. ","The Hungarian government has a long history of attacking, intimidating, and discrediting civil society, media workers, and critical voices. It started with the stigmatization of civil society organizations that receive funding from abroad. The variety of tools it applied to stifle dissenting voices became more diverse over the years. The Pegasus case is, however, distinct from these, as, without the investigation, we wouldn’t have known about it.

Independent UN experts condemn internet and communication shutdown in Kashmir,"On 22 August 2019, independent UN experts, including the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, issued a statement condemning the Indian government's move to impose a complete internet and communication shutdown in Kashmir. In the statement issued, the experts condemn the move and describe it as: “The shutdown of the internet and telecommunication networks, without justification from the Government, are inconsistent with the fundamental norms of necessity and proportionality,” They add: “The blackout is a form of collective punishment of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, without even a pretext of a precipitating offence.”
(Further reading:  https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2019/08/un-rights-experts-urge-india-end-communications-shutdown-kashmir )

A day before the Union government abrogated Article 370, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, it imposed restrictions on movement and connectivity.  Besides targeting the internet and telecommunications, there were restrictions on movement on the ground; local leaders were detained, and the press was not allowed to report freely. 

This was the beginning of a series of communication blockades in the form of social media bans, landline restrictions, provision of only 2G services, etc. 4G services were restored on 5th February 2021.","The restrictions were likely imposed to curb any protests or agitations arising from the sudden abrogation of Article 370. As per news sources, the government justified the restrictions by calling them necessary to ensure national security and peace in the region.  In Parliament, addressing concerns about the lack of internet and communication facilities, Home Minister Amit Shah clarified that these measures were necessary for ""preventing some nefarious elements from instigating violence in the State"" and that ""no one can stop the government to take precautionary measures to protect the peace inside the country.""
Speaking to media sources, an article published in 2022 notes that the Minister of Foreign Affairs commented: ""The big song and dance about the internet being cut…if you've reached a stage where you say that an internet cut is more dangerous than loss of human lives, then what can I say?"" 
The government has described the abrogation as a positive move that was much needed. In a press note, it described the move as follows: ""The Indian parliament passed legislation last month changing the status of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, modifying provisions that have been an obstacle to economic development and promoted a sense of separatism.

"Investigation into China reveals that the country expanded the scope of its surveillance, asking hotels to place police cameras in their lobbies.","Researchers of digital authoritarianism have investigated many incidents revealing the Chinese's government extensive use of surveillance technology. This incident helps us go one step further to understand how the Chinese police expanded the scope of government-led surveillance. 

The New York Times reviewed over 100,000 documents provided by the digital magazine ChinaFile regarding the increasing use of surveillance technologies in the country. According to records, the Chinese police wanted to place cameras in places where people go to fulfill their common needs, like eating, traveling, shopping and entertainment. 

One finding in the documents was that the police wanted to place facial recognition cameras in hotel lobbies, such as Sheraton Hotel. This incident shows that the government attempts to expand its surveillance from the streets to hotels and many other places, violating the privacy of its citizens.

To fully understand China's expanding surveillance and control mechanism, it is essential to note that the government cooperates with big tech companies which are producing surveillance technologies. For this very reason, Hikvision and Dahua, two Chinese companies dominating the surveillance technology market, were sanctioned by the United States for taking part in China's human rights violations.

The items linked to this incident approach it from a thematic perspective, looking at media items related to this incident and to surveillance at a broader level, asking, ""How are states justifying their surveillance measures and how are civil society actors responding?""","The main motivation of the Chinese government is to create an overarching control mechanism in the country, which would help the government track, control, and punish its citizens' activities. In so doing, the government could regulate the behaviors, especially of its minorities, and prevent them from getting organized against the government's atrocities. ",China,21 June 2022,2022

Here is what the Facebook Papers reveal:
- Facebook's administration knew that Facebook and Instagram were affecting young people's mental health severely, but they did not take any measures to change this situation, eliminate the risks, and improve the platform's algorithms accordingly.
- Facebook administration's negligence of disinformation and conspiracy theories on its platforms played a major role in the organization of insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.

- Facebook administration was well-aware of the fact that the Chinese government was surveilling Uyghurs, a Turkic-Muslim minority group mostly known for the cultural genocide they face. However, the administration ignored state surveillance for the sake of the company's profit in the Asian markets.
- Despite being one of the leading social media companies in the world, Facebook did not hire enough experts who could speak different languages and have expertise in different regions of the world.

Venezuelan regional elections spark rise of website and digital media blocks,"During the regional elections (where mayors, governors and community leaders are chosen) in November 2021, VE Sin Filtro (an NGO that has been documenting censorship and web blocking since 2014) determined that over 56 key web domains relevant to the election were blocked during the month of November, which prevented users from accessing information, as traditional media outlets have disappeared or are subject to censorship.
Between January and December 2021, VE Sin Filtro found that 59 websites corresponding to at least 68 domains were blocked. Forty-five of these were media sites; eight belonged to portals that offer political content; four had been designed to share multimedia content; three are run by human rights organizations, six had adult content, and two were VPN (Virtual Private Network) platforms used to avoid censorship.

Russia issues first conviction for spreading 'fake news',"Pyotr Mylnikov is an admin of a Viber chat called I Live in Rubble, dedicated to the problems of his village in the Chita region. He was charged with distributing fake information about the Russian army for two messages posted in that chat. The court imposed a fine of 1m roubles ($16k), and it was the first sentence under this new article.
On March 5, shortly after the full-fledged invasion of Ukraine, Russia passed a law expanding its criminal code to penalize anyone found guilty of knowingly spreading false information about Russia's armed forces (Criminal Code, art. 207.3).

Others are ordinary people with a small online following. These cases concern both online and offline actions, but primarily online.   
Pyotr Mylnikov was one of the first people charged under this law and the first to be sentenced.

China detained 897 people within the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic for their online speech or information-sharing,"In June 2020, Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) released a report about human rights violations in China during the earliest times of COVID-19.

Among detainees, there have been Chinese journalists, such as Chen Qiushi, Fang Bin, and Li Zehua. 

The report also indicated that the number of detainees could be higher than 897 for two reasons. First, the families of many detainees avoided sharing information because they were afraid of the Chinese government's reaction. Therefore, there could be more detainees whose information could not be identified by CHRD. Secondly, the government detained many people, who criticized the Chinese government's pandemic policies, under the pretext of mandatory quarantine. Therefore, there could be more detainees who had been forcibly held by the Chinese government.","According to the report, the Chinese authorities detained online platform users under the guise of ""spreading rumors"" about the government's COVID-19 policies, ""fabricating false information"" about the pandemic, and ""causing panic"" among Chinese citizens by misleading them through disinformation.

Along with the government's claims about the detainees, it is important to remember that the Chinese government has been detaining people because of telling the truth about the pandemic since the earliest case of COVID-19 was announced by doctors who the government also detained. Therefore, although the government detained people due to the so-called reasons mentioned above, it is evident that the government uses those reasons as an excuse to prevent people from criticizing the government online and punishing them for their anti-government attitudes.",China,10 June 2020,2020

The incident attracted international outrage as it reflects the Kagame regime's strong intolerance for dissenting views and freedom of expression.","The state is cracking down on voices of dissent in order to send a chilling message to like minded critics of the regime, that they face the same fate or worse. It is a calculated intimidation tactic of using the law as a weapon to crackdown on citizens who criticize the government and it is hoped that using this method will quell any prospects of a mass uprising.

When Idamange was arrested on the 15th of February, the Rwandan Police pointed out that she had exhibited behavior ""that mixes politics, criminality, and madness"" in her use of media platforms. This narrative thread runs throughout most of the regime's justification for clamping down on voices critical of the regime and is basically a psychological operation aimed at discrediting alternative voices.

It can be inferred that the government increasingly became concerned that Idamange appeared to give a voice to the voiceless citizens of Rwanda, and that her following on YouTube was growing. Such a scenario is untenable for any authoritarian regime which aims to control public sentiment and behavior. The regime seemed shaken by the prospect of a popular uprising by citizens, as her posts apparently set in motion a movement which made public the gross failures, totalitarian tendencies and inimical policies of the Kagame led government.

The government was also shaken by Idamange's public expose's of corruption, assassination of high profile figures including the death of a music star in state detention, as well as systematic torture and forced disappearances of critics of the regime through her YouTube channel. Arresting Idamange seemed the best option to thwart critical views.",Rwanda,30 September 2021,2021
Kyrgyzstan: Mass detention of critics who protested on social media against the controversial border deal with Uzbekistan,"A series of detentions occurred in Kyrgyzstan against civil society activists, ex-politicians and acting politicians between 23-27th October 2022. In total, 27 people were arrested and detained for two months before their trial, including six women, some with minor children. The critics publicly spoke against the handover of the Kempir-Abad water reservoir to Uzbekistan as a border deal agreement between the two countries through their social media channels and during the public assembly (Kurultai) organized in Özgön on October 15th. Most of the detained activists were members of the Committee to save Kempir-Abad, which was formed after the public assembly. The members of the Committee declared their intention to hold a nationwide public meeting on October 26th in the capital Bishkek on the issue of the water reservoir. The detainees are accused of alleged mass riot organization attempts after the security forces released three audio conversations between some of the organizers, allegedly about a planned power overthrow. According to the Criminal Code, the punishment can reach up to 10 years of imprisonment. The regime is watching (conducting surveillance), monitoring social media and punishing regime critics.          ","Bearing in mind the volatile political context of the country in the past (three power overthrows since independence in 1991), the incumbent regime is afraid that the Kempir-Abad water reservoir border deal can lead to mass riots and put an end to their rule. This has been exacerbated by the failure of the government to protect citizens during the violent Tajik military aggression in the Batken and Osh oblasts in September 2022. The political opposition and civic activists nationwide have managed to unite by establishing the Committee to save Kempir-Abad and could possibly become a major challenging force with major public support.",Kyrgyzstan,23 October 2022,2022
Cameroon plantation worker locked up for viral video on embezzlement of Covid-19 funds ,"A plantation worker, Clement Ytembe Bonda, is currently locked up at the Mbanga Prison in the Littoral Region of Cameroon. Bonda and two of his friends, Andre Boris Wamen and Flavy Kamou Woume recorded a video expressing their anger at the president and ministers for the embezzlement of FCFA 180 billion Covid-19 funds. They were angry as workers earning FCFA 32,000 were toiling on the plantation, only for government officials to embezzle at their expense. This criticism insulted the president and the ministers. Bonda and his friends were arrested and jailed for outrage against the head of state and the propagation of fake news on social media. Two of them were freed a year later while Clement Ytembe Bonda is still in prison. A member of parliament organized lawyers to defend the young men because according to him, there is a need to defend their rights and the general freedom of expression.

State threatens to to block Wikipedia in Russia ,"Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Wikipedia has been in the sights of Russian media authorities. Particularly, state officials are demanding the blocking of Wikipedia since Wikipedia's Russian-language articles on the war deviate from the Kremlin's official account.","Russian authorities have threatened to block Wikipedia's Russian-language site over articles that refer to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

"Philippine government agency blocks websites of 2 media outlets, 25 others","The National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) issued a memorandum dated June 8, 2022, ordering internet service providers in the Philippines to implement DNS blocking against 27 websites for allegedly being ""terrorist friendly."" Two of these websites are media organizations and several others are websites of NGOs critical of government policies. No due process was observed and no evidence is presented to support the claims. The NTC attached a letter from then National Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon Jr., citing Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC) resolutions designating several organizations and individuals as terrorists. Many of the blocked websites, however, are not designated as terrorists by the ATC. ","The NTC order is just the recent form of state censorship against independent media and critical voices in the Philippines. The two media outlets, Bulatlat and Pinoy Weekly, were also subjected to cyber-attacks. The distributed denial of service attacks against Bulatlat in 2021 was traced to the Philippine Army.",Philippines,8 June 2022,2022
Kenyan Government rolls out a Device Management System capable of nationwide communications surveillance,"On various dates in January 2017, the Kenyan Government, through its Communications Authority, contracted the country's three major mobile network operators to implement the Device Management System (DMS). The action would involve installing a communication surveillance system across mobile networks that would reportedly allow unbridled access to mobile subscriber information. DMS presents a dangerous surveillance tool as it can spy on subscribers' calls and texts and review mobile money transactions. Further, this data would be available to be cross-referenced by other state agencies and would be available to third parties. 

On 19th April 2020, this was halted through a constitutional petition filed by civil society actors, which succeeded on the grounds of privacy violations and a lack of public participation. However, just a few days later, on 24th April 2020, this decision was set aside by Kenya's Court of Appeal, which permitted the implementation of DMS. 

The same civil society actors have now approached the Supreme Court to appeal the Court of Appeal's decision. However, the position remains that the implementation of DMS is permitted. ","The justification provided by the state through the Communications Authority was national security concerns, specifically, the system was to be introduced with the primary intention of curbing the use of counterfeit and illegal mobile phones in the country. 
However, the true motives of the state are better anticipated when we look at the implementation of a Device Management System (DMS) as a part of a bigger communications surveillance conspiracy by the Kenyan government. As the country has advanced in terms of internet and mobile phone connectivity, a concerning trend of communications surveillance has been observed. According to an investigative report by Privacy International, this trend features ""intercepted communications content and data are used to facilitate gross human rights abuses, to spy on, profile, locate, track — and ultimately arrest, torture, kill or disappear suspects.""
It can be said that the question of why the Kenyan government wants to surveil mobile network communication across the country, does not have a definite answer, however, considering the above trend and the authoritarian notoriety of the Kenyan government, we can anticipate that the implementation of a DMS is part of a larger web of state surveillance purposed to establish authoritarian control over the Kenyan people.

Kazakhstan: Allegations of Pro-Tokayev coordinated inauthentic behaviour in the lead-up to 2022 Presidential elections,"During the leadership of former president Nursultan Nazarbayev, the presence of 'nurbots' was widely acknowledged in local civic discourse. 

These internet bots were paid by an agency to post content and comments that were favourable to the regime online and on social media platforms. In the lead-up to the snap presidential elections of 2022, some critics and activists alleged that President Tokayev was employing a similar strategy, as characterised by a rising amount of content that praised him and presented him as the only true leader for the country. Some have shared screenshots of private communication indicating that users have been given pre-approved content to spread en masse, with anecdotal evidence that social media campaigns were ramped up by the pro-state apparatus in the build-up to the elections. 

Another discourse surrounding bots consists of a frequently used argument by Tokayev who alleges that the country's cyberspace and his regime are under attack by foreign actors trying to destabilise Kazakhstan. Facebook's Quarter 3 'Adversarial Threat Report' for 2022 also confirms a US-origin network operating in Kazakhstan, among other countries, was banned on Meta platforms after violating its policies on coordinated inauthentic behaviour.

Theis activity is believed to happen in suburban areas and villages of Kazakhstan. Fake accounts spread regime-praising comments on social media and feedback in media articles that are relevant to the current political agenda. These accounts imitate social consent to claim the president's rule is based on people's will.

The items linked to this incident provide context about the country's history with coordinated inauthentic behaviour, the general climate leading up to the elections of 2022, and examples and allegations of non-organic image promotion on social media.","The main motive behind these alleged pro-government influence campaigns is to increase the media visibility of the president, increase support for his reforms, and provide the basis for popular legitimacy when it comes to the statistics of public opinion.

Kyrgyzstan: Ministry shuts down Azattyk-RFE/RL's website for two months,"Azattyk-RFE/RL's website was shut for two months after the Ministry of Culture, Information, Sport and Youth of the Kyrgyz Republic issued a decision on October 26th 2022. The ministry stated that the RFE/RL-affiliated “Nastoyashee Vremya” (Current Time) channel, during its airing, disseminated unconfirmed information related to the Kyrgyz and Tajik clashes in Batken oblast in September 2022. The Ministry stated that the channel was not impartial and had taken the Tajik side when reporting the news. 

The termination of the media outlet’s website was possible due to the so-called law against fake news (the Law on Protection from False Information). According to some activists, the real reason for the closure was the investigative material published by Azattyk about the controversial Kempir-Abad water reservoir issue. The investigation provided details on the border deal and shared historic facts about the Kempir-Abad reservoir’s foundation, and amplified local voices on how the decision might impact the daily lives of local residents. On October 31 2022, Azattyk’s bank accounts were frozen based on an order from the State Committee on the National Security of the Kyrgyz Republic. 
On 26 December 2022, the closure of the media outlet was extended by the Kyrgyz authorities who stated that access would be reinstated when the controversial material was removed from the website, which the RFE/RL viewed as pressure on media expression. ","After the rise of Sadyr Zhaparov to power as president, the country is moving towards authoritarianism. The government's moves indicate that it intends to take control of all media (including social media) and wants to silence critical media outlets. The number of Facebook or other social media users who are censored and interrogated by Kyrgyz security services for their criticism of the president and the incumbent government is skyrocketing. Since the beginning of 2022, dozens of bloggers have been censored and interrogated by security services for posting and re-posting material on their social media. The Kyrgyz government has become increasingly engaged in the censorship of the population’s social media posts, thereby undermining the right to freedom of expression. 

So far, the procedural changes  include the adoption of a Law against fake news in August 2021 and currently efforts are being made in order to introduce a law on foreign agents. Prior to the closure of Azattyk outlet's website, on October 13th, 2022 near the office of Azattyk in Bishkek, a group of people held a protest with banners demanding the closure of the offices of Azattyk and other critical media such as Kloop.kg and Kaktus.media. They blamed Azattyk, Kloop.kg and Kaktus.media for disinformation during the Tajik invasion of Kyrgyzstan and the June clashes in the south of Kyrgyzstan in 2010, for the promotion of political instability and non-traditional values, such as LGBT rights. The leader of the protest, Ilimbek Israilov threatened to burn down the building housing Azattyk if the Kyrgyz parliament did not adopt the Law on foreign agents, which was initiated by MP Narmatova Nadira.                ",Kyrgyzstan,26 October 2022,2022
Chinese government denounces Hong Kong media survey where respondents express concern about digital surveillance,"On 5 November 2021, the Foreign Correspondents' Club (FCC) in Hong Kong issued the results of a recent survey among its members regarding the work environment for journalists in Hong Kong since the implementation of the National Security law in June 2020. The findings suggested a perceived deterioration of media freedoms in Hong Kong and a majority of respondents (journalists based in Hong Kong) expressed concern about digital surveillance. 37% had deleted images, either online or on their devices. A few hours after the results were released on the website of the FCC, the spokesperson of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China issued a strongly worded response which referred to the survey as misleading, not representative and not credible. It further accused the FCC of interfering in Hong Kong affairs. 

Before that, the Hong Kong and Chinese governments maintained a narrative that the 2019 protests were mainly instigated and funded by foreign forces. In this context, foreign media has become a frequent target and is sometimes accused of smearing local authorities and interfering with domestic affairs. 

In 2018, authorities harshly criticized the FCC for organizing a talk with a pro-independence activist, questioning if the Club should be allowed to continue the lease of its current premises. The renewal became an issue again in 2022, with the Club being accused of compromising its role in order to secure a lease renewal from the government.

Online media platform Stand News was raided by Hong Kong Police Force,"On 29 December 2021, the online media platform Stand News was raided by the National Security Department of the Hong Kong police force. Six persons were arrested and detained. At the end of that day, Stand News ceased all operations and removed its website content. One day later, its UK branch was shut down as well. While the organization was not directly forced to shut down by authorities (it closed down ""voluntarily""), this decision came amidst high-profile arrests (and the subsequent closure) targeting the popular opposition news outlet, Apple Daily, which had been raided earlier that year. A few days after the closure of Stand News, another online media platform, Citizen News, announced its dissolution, citing the risk to its employees. 
The National Security Law was implemented in June 2020, in response to the social unrest that unfolded in Hong Kong between June and December 2019. The law was introduced as a constitutional annexe, and was directly imposed by the Central Government in Beijing. Given the impact on three leading media organizations, the law significantly impacted online and offline media freedoms in Hong Kong.",The media outlet in question is accused of having breached the law by publishing seditious content.,China,29 December 2021,2021
Kenya's ruling party registered citizens as members without their knowledge and consent,"In the months leading up to the August 2022 Kenyan elections, the ruling party, Jubilee, along with the other primary political parties, was implicated in the illegal mass registration of citizens. This is said to have been done through the Office of the Registrar of Political Parties which is the state agency that keeps and maintains political party membership records. This constituted an egregious breach of privacy that features both unauthorised access and misuse of the personal information of Kenyans, including their signatures, in a clear effort to advance certain political aims. It is further worth noting that this is not the first time Kenyans have been fraudulently registered to political parties. 

A Tweet on 18 June 2021 raised the alarm that one Twitter user had been registered to the Jubilee party without his knowledge or consent. This was followed by concerned Kenyans checking their registration status on the online e-citizen platform (which is the digital platform used to access government services in Kenya). Most of them were shocked to find out that they were registered as belonging to political parties they did not subscribe to. Many took to social media to express their shock and anger. From the social media reports, it was apparent that of all the political parties implicated, most people were fraudulently registered to the ruling Jubilee Party. Some Kenyans reported this to the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner which reported having received over 200 complaints. 

Following the uproar on Twitter, the Office of the Registrar of Political Parties (ORPP) distanced itself from the incident. Totally denying the possibility of a data privacy breach or misuse of citizens' personal data, the state agency called it a mere mishap due to the fact that they were in the pilot stage of the process of digitizing the political parties' membership registry and integrating it with the e-citizen platform. Further, the state agency, through its then director, stated that this might be the fault of Kenyans who could have forgotten that they had registered for certain political parties. The explanations provided, however, do not hold much water as some citizens reported having been registered as members of political parties years before some of these parties were even formed. This was the case for several of those registered under the Jubilee Party. Eventually, following social media pressure, the ORPP committed to a de-registration process for those aggrieved and stated the intention to hold the implicated political parties accountable, but no such action was ever taken by the state agency. 

The Jubilee Party, like the other implicated political parties, remained silent on the issue. The party did not state its motivations or justifications for this incident. However, considering the history of this and similar incidents and the fact that they always precede an election year, there is no other conclusion other than that the intentions were to commit some kind of electoral interference or fraud. This argument is further supported by the fact that prior to the August 2022 polls, the ORPP reported discrepancies in the numbers of registered voters and political party membership numbers. ","None of the political parties spoke on this, therefore their motive remains unclear. However, it can be anticipated that this was done in an effort to increase the number of members registered with the Jubilee party, most probably in an effort to facilitate some kind of unfair advantage for the Jubilee Party in the upcoming 2022 elections.",Kenya,18 June 2021,2021
Cameroon journalist jailed for reports and social media posts about the ongoing Anglophone Conflict ,"Journalist Njoka Kingsley is languishing at the Yaounde Kondengui Prison under charges of 'terrorism'. At the time of arrest, he was accused of sponsoring armed groups who provided information for his reports and social media posts. He was a freelance journalist and contributed to a programme in one of Cameroon's local TV stations, CANAL 2, and L'Effort Camerounaise, a Catholic newspaper. 

According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Njoka Kingsley said he left the Northwest region'a conflict hotspot because he was being targeted by state authorities. This was because his reports were providing information and updates on the Anglophone conflict, a six-year crisis that is being fought largely between separatist fighters and the Cameroonian military. 

Kingsley Njoka is not a prominent journalist, but as has been routine for the government, he is among the journalists who have been jailed for reporting about the Anglophone conflict. The case of journalist Mimi Mefo who was jailed for her reporting, which the government tagged as propagating fake news on the conflict, is a glaring example. When released, she had to flee the country to Germany, from where she now reports. Another example is the arrest of Samuel Wazizi (a journalist accused of supporting separatists) who died in jail. His remains have, till today (January 2023), not been given to his family. Many Anglophone journalists quit their jobs or self-censor, in fear for their lives.

It should be noted that since 2016, the Anglophone crisis, which largely laid dormant over the years, took a different dimension. It stems from the grievance of the English-speaking regions that they have been marginalized by the French-speaking majority. Cameroon is made up of 20 per cent Anglophones and 80 per cent Francophones. The two sides, initially partitioned between the British and French, came together as the United Republic of Cameroon. But over the years, the terms of unity gradually eroded. Eventually, separatist tendencies took over and the conflict turned into an armed conflict and is ongoing to date. Today, government forces are fighting armed groups in the Anglophone regions. ","The government does not want to attract international attention as they have claimed there is no problem. Allowing journalists to relate what is happening to the outside world would be bad for the image of the country.  The government justifies the arrest as trying to safeguard territorial integrity, public peace, and security. ",Cameroon,15 May 2020,2020
In Kazakhstan: dissident arrested and charged with spreading 'false information' on social media,"On February 26, 2022, the Kazakh opposition leader Zhanbolat Mamay was arrested for organizing a rally in memory of the January protests' victims a month earlier. He was subsequently rearrested on two new criminal charges. One of them was for insulting law enforcement officers and the second was for distributing 'false information' after he broadcast meetings with government officials on his social media. In sum, he has been accused of spreading disinformation and organising mass protests (Criminal Code 272), ""propaganda of destructive attitudes, contributing to the growth of protest activism"".

Human rights organizations and independent journalists believe his detention and trial are politically motivated. The case of Mamay exemplifies the nature of digital authoritarianism in Kazakhstan during the political transition from president Nazarbayev to Tokayev. 

Mamay's arrests came in the aftermath of the January 2022 protests that were marked by unprecedented violence and national riots. What started as peaceful protests against rising gas prices in Western Kazakhstan took a violent turn and shook the country. The protests are referred to as Qandy Qantar or Bloody January. Access to the internet and social media was blocked during the protests by the government in an attempt to control information flow. State-owned media monopolised the coverage of the January protests, spreading the ruling regime's position, arguing that foreign actors had infiltrated the protest groups and were trying to destabilise the country. Opposition and independent journalists sharing their views about the January protests on social media were accused of spreading disinformation and endangering state security. 

It was the context of Bloody January that enabled the government to crack down so harshly on Mamay. Therefore, to place the arrest within a broader context, the harms and controls described below also include those leveraged by the government against other actors during the protests.",To crack down on any dissent or criticism that would threaten the legitimacy of President Tokayev's rule.,Kazakhstan,26 February 2022,2022
